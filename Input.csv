"5. Mr. Goolam E. Vahanvati, Solicitor General (now Attorney- General for India) had appeared as amicus curiae in the present matter and referred to the facts herein as an illustration of how parties involved in cheque bounce cases usually seek the compounding of the offence at a very late stage. The interests of justice would indeed be better served if parties resorted to compounding as a method to resolve their disputes at an early stage instead of engaging in protracted litigation before several forums, thereby causing undue delay, expenditure and strain on part of the judicial system. This is clearly a situation that is causing some concern, since Section 147 of the Act does not prescribe as to what stage is appropriate for compounding the offence and whether the same can be done at the instance of the complainant or with the leave of the court. The learned Attorney General stressed on the importance of using compounding as an expedient method to hasten the disposal of cases. In this regard, the learned Attorney General has proposed that this Court should frame some guidelines to disincentivise litigants from seeking the compounding of the offence at an unduly late stage of litigation. In other words, judicial directions have been sought to nudge litigants in cheque bounce cases to opt for compounding during the early stages of litigation, thereby bringing down the arrears.",Criminal Case

"13. In view of the challenge by the respondent to the constitutional validity of the Amendment Acts, 1974 and 1975, notice was given to the Attorney General.

14. The appeals were to be heard on August 11, 1975. In view of the Constitutional (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975 which came into existence on August 10, 1975 the hearing was adjourned till August 25, 1975.

31. Parliament itself can also hear election disputes. That was the English practice until the Grenville Act, 1868 when Parliament conferred power on courts. Before 1770, controverted elections were tried by the whole House of Commons as party questions. The House found that the exercise of its privilege could be submitted to a tribunal constituted by law to secure impartiality in the administration of justice according to the laws of the land. In 1868 the jurisdiction of the House in the trial of controverted elections was transferred by statute to the courts of law. The present procedure is contained in the English Representation of the People Act, 1949. The trial is confided to judges selected from the Judiciary. Provision is made in each case for constituting a rota from whom these judges are selected. The House has no cognizance of these proceedings until their determination when the judges are to make a purpose. Trial is not a proceeding of the House. The judges certify their determination, in writing,

33. The legal order is a system of general and individual norms connected with each other according to the principle that law regulates its own creation. Each norm of this order is created according to the provisions of another norm and ultimately according to the provisions of the basic norm constituting the unity of this system, the legal order. A norm belongs to a certain legal order, because it is created by an organ of the legal community constituted by this order. Creation of law is application of law. The creation of a legal norm is normally an application of the higher norm, regulating its creation. The application of higher norm is the creation of lower norm determined by the higher norm. A judicial decision is an act by which a general norm, a statute, is applied but at the same time an individual norm is created binding one or both parties to the conflict. Legislation is creation of law. Taking it into account is applicable of law. The higher norm may determine the organ and the procedure by which

34. The general norm which attaches abstractly determined consequences, has to be applied to concrete cases in order that the sanction determined in abstract may be ordered and executed in concrete. The two essential elements of judicial functions are to apply a pre-existing general norm in which a certain consequence is attached to certain conditions. The existence of the concrete conditions in connection with the concrete consequence are what may be called individualization of the general and abstract norm to the individual norm of the judicial decision.

38. The power of the Legislature to validate matters which have been found by judgments or orders of competent courts and tribunals to be invalid or illegal is a well-known pattern. The Legislature validates acts and things done by which the basis of judgments or orders of competent courts and tribunals is changed and the judgments and orders are made ineffective. All the sales tax validation cases, the election validation cases are illustrations of that proposition. The present appeals are not of the type of providing indemnity against penalties or determining existing facts to be treated in accordance with change of law.

70. In Bradlaugh v. Gossett Bradlaugh claimed to make affirmation instead of taking the oath. He was permitted to make the affirmation ""subject to any liability by statute"", and took his seat. Upon an action for penalties it was decided, finally by the House of Lords, that Bradlaugh had not qualified himself to sit by making the affirmation. On re-election, he attempted to take the oath, but was prevented by order of the House which eventually directed the Sergeant to exclude him from the House until he undertook to create no further disturbance. Bradlaugh then brought an action against the Sergeant in order to obtain a ""declaration that the order of the House was beyond the power and jurisdiction of the House and void, and an order restraining the Sergeant at Arms from preventing Bradlaugh by force from entering the House""

. It was held that the Court had no power to restrain the executive officer of the House from carrying out the order of the House. The reason is that the House is not subject to the contro
72. The present mode of releasing arrested members goes back to Shirley's case. In 1603 Shirley was imprisoned in the Fleet, in execution, before the meeting of Parliament. The Commons first tried to bring him into the House by habeas corpus, and then sent the Sergeant to demand his release. The warden refused to give up his prisoner. At length the warden delivered up the prisoner.

82. These being the general declarations of the law of Parliament, the House will not allow even the sanctuary of its walls to protect a member from the process of criminal law, although a service of a criminal process on a member within the precincts of Parliament, whilst the House is sitting without obtaining the leave of the House, would be a breach of privilege.

83. The committal of a member in England for high treason or any criminal offence is brought before the House by a letter addressed to the Speaker by the committing judge or magistrate. Where a member is convicted but released on bail pending an appeal, the duty of the Magistrate to communicate with the Speaker does not arise. No duty of informing the Speaker arises in the case of a person who while in prison under sentence of a court is elected as a member of Parliament. In the case of detention of members under Regulation 14B of the Defence of Realm Regulations in England, the communication was made to the Speaker by a letter from the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland which was read to the House by the Speaker. The detention of a member under Regulation 18B of the Defence (General) Regulations, 1939, made under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, 1939 and 1940, led to the Committee of Privileges being directed to consider whether such detention constituted a breach of the privileges of the

88. The High Court found first that the appellant has to be regarded as a candidate from December 29, 1970 as she held herself out on that date as a candidate. The second finding is that the appellant obtained and procured the assistance of Yashpal Kapur for the furtherance of her election prospects when Yashpal Kapur was serving as a gazetted officer with the Government of India. The High Court found that Yashpal Kapur's resignation from his service though submitted on January 13, 1971 did not become effective until January 25, 1971 when it was notified. The further finding by the High Court is that Yashpal Kapur under the instructions of the appellant delivered election speech on January 7, 1971 at Munshi Ganj and another speech at Kalan on January 19, 1971. The third finding by the High Court is that the appellant and her election agent Yashpal Kapur procured and obtained the assistance of the officers of the State Government, particularly, the District Magistrate, the Superintendent of Police, the Execut

102. The issue pressed by the respondent was that the appellant and her election agent Yashpal Kapur incurred or authorised expenditure in excess of the amount prescribed by Section 77 of the 1951 Act read with Rule 90. The respondent alleged that the election expenses of the appellant, inter alia, were Rs. 1, 28, 700 on account of hiring charges of vehicles, Rs. 43, 230 on account of cost of petrol and diesel; Rs. 9, 900 on account payments made to the drivers of the vehicles. The respondent further alleged that the appellant spent Rs. 1, 32, 000 on account of construction of rostrums for public meetings on February 1, 1971 and February 25, 1971. The respondent contended that the findings of the High Court should be reversed.

104. With regard to hiring charges of vehicles the High Court found that the respondent did not examine any witness to indicate as to whether the vehicles were used only for party propaganda or they were used in connection with the election of the appellant. The High Court further found that the documents which were relied on by the respondent did not establish that the vehicles had been engaged or used in connection with the election work of the appellant.

105. The respondent repeated the following contentions which had been advanced before the High Court. Dal Bahadur Singh, President, District Congress Committee wrote a letter to the District Election Officer intimating that 23 vehicles had been engaged by the District Congress Committee for election work in Rae Bareli, Amethi and Ram Sanehi Ghat constituencies, and, therefore, the vehicles should be derequisitioned. Dal Bahadur Singh thereafter wrote a note to Yashpal Kapur and requested that the letter be sent to the District Election Officer to that effect. Yashpal Kapur wrote a letter to the District Election Officer and repeated the prayer contained in Dal Bahadur Singh's letter. It was, therefore, contended that because Yashpal Kapur was the election agent of the appellant and he moved for the derequisition of the vehicles it should be inferred that the vehicles were engaged for the election of the appellant. Yaspal Kapur said that the vehicles were used in the three parliamentary constituencies. The Hi

118. In Ram Dayal v. Brijraj Singh the appellant challenged the election of the respondent on the ground that the Maharaja and the Rajmata of Gwalior had helped the respondent's election in a number of ways and acted as his agents and the respondent incurred considerable expenditure which exceeded the limit. This Court found that assuming the expenditure was incurred by the Maharaja and the Rajmata of Gwalior for the purpose of canvassing votes, in the absence of any evidence to show that the Maharaja and the Rajmata acted as election agents or that the expenditure was authorised by the respondent, it was not liable to be included in the election expenses.

147. The contention of the respondent is that if a candidate is free to spend as much as a candidate likes before the date of nomination a great premium would be placed on free use of money before the date of nomination. The 1951 Act specifies what election expenses are of a candidate. The statute specifies time in regard to a candidate. That time cannot be enlarged or reduced. The holding out by a person of (sic of) candidature was a flexible and elastic idea. The date of nomination is definite and doubtless. Different views may be taken as to the time of holding out. The Legislature has now set the matter at rest.

154. The symbol allotted to the party of the appellant was characterised by the respondent as a religious symbol. Under Article 324 the superintendence, direction and control of elections to Parliament, is vested in the Election Commission. Rule 5 of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 states that the Election Commission shall, by notification in the Gazette of India and in the Official Gazette of each State, specify the symbols that may be chosen by candidates at elections in parliamentary or assembly constituencies and the restrictions to which their choice shall be subject. Rule 10(4) of the 1961 Rules aforesaid states that at an election in a parliamentary or assembly constituency, where a poll becomes necessary, the returning officer shall consider the choice of symbols, expressed by the contesting candidates in their nomination papers and shall, subject to any general or special direction issued in this behalf by the Election Commission allot a different symbol to each contesting candidate in conformi

160. The President of India called upon different constituencies in the country to elect members to the Lok Sabha by notification dated January 27, 1971 under Section 14(2) of the R. P. Act. Last date for filling nomination papers was fixed as February 3, 1971 for Rae Bareli constituency by the Election Commission. The appellant filed her nomination paper on February 1, 1971. The appellant was for a number of years before the election Prime Minister of India and is since then continuing to hold that office. Yaspal Kapur, who was previously a gazetted officer in the Government of India holding the post of Officer on Special Duty in the Prime Minister Secretariat and who subsequently submitted his resignation, was appointed the election agent of the appellant. The signed form about the appointment of Yashpal Kapur an election agent was submitted to the Returning Officer on February 4, 1971, the date of scrutiny. The date on the which Yashpal Kapur submitted his resignation and the same became effective is, how(1) The appellant held herself out as a prospective candidate from the Rae Bareli constituency immediately after the dissolution of the Lok Sabha on December 27, 1970, and for furtherance of her election prospects, she obtained and procured the assistance of Yashpal Kapur who was at that time holding the post of Officer on Special Duty. The appellant thus committed corrupt practice under Section 123(7) of the R. P. Act.

(2) The appellant and her election agent procured the assistance of members of armed forces of the Union for furtherance of her election prospects inasmuch as the members of the armed forces arranged planes and helicopters of the Air Force at her instance for her flights to enable her to address meetings in her constituency. The appellant thereby committed corrupt practice under Section 123(7) of the R. P. Act.

(3) The appellant and her election agent obtained the assistance of a number of gazetted officers and members of the police force for the furtherance of her election prospects inasmuch as the services of the District Magistrate, Superintendent of Police, Rae Bareli and the Home Secretary, Uttar Pradesh Government were utilised for the purposes of the construction of rostrums and installation of loudspeakers at various places within the constituency where the appellant addressed her election meetings as also for the purpose of making arrangement of barricading and posting of police personnel on the routes by which the appellant was to travel in her constituency and at the places where she was to address meetings, in order to give publicity to her visits and thus attract large crowds. The appellant was thereby stated to have committed corrupt practice under Section 123(7) of the R. P. Act.

(4) Yashpal Kapur, election agent of the appellant and her other agents with the consent of Yashpal Kapur, freely distributed quilts, blankets, dhotis and liquor among the voters to induce them to vote for her and thereby the appellant committed corrupt practice of bribery under Section 123(1) of the R. P. Act.(5) The appellant and her election agent made extensive appeals to the religious symbol of cow and calf and thereby committed corrupt practice under Section 123(3) of the R. P. Act.

164. The High Court decided issues Nos. 2, 4, 6 and 7 in favour of the appellant and against the respondent. Issues Nos. 5, 8 and 10 were found in favour of respondent and against the appellant. On issue No. 9 the finding of the High Court was that the total amount of expenditure incurred or authorised by the appellant or her election together with the expenditure proved to have been incurred by the party or by the State Government in connection with the appellant's election amounted to Rs. 31, 976.47 which was sufficiently below the prescribed limit of Rs. 35, 000. The appellant as such was held not guilty of any corrupt practice under Section 123(6) of the R. P. Act. As the respondent was found to have failed to prove that the expenses of the appellant or her election agent, together with the expenses found to have been incurred by the political party and the State Government in connection with the appellant's election exceeded the prescribed limit, the High Court held that no ground had been made out for in

165. On additional issue No. 2, the finding of the High Court was that the appellant held herself out as a candidate from the Rae Bareli parliamentary constituency on December 29, 1970. Issue No. 3 was decided by the High Court against the appellant. It was held that the appellant obtained the assistance of the officers of the U. P. Government, particularly the District Magistrate, Superintendent of Police, the Executive Engineer, P. W. D. and the Engineer, Hydel Department for construction of rostrums and arrangement of supply of power for loudspeakers in the meeting addressed by her on February 1, 1971 and February 25, 1971 in furtherance of her election prospects. The appellant, as such was found guilty of corrupt practice under Section 123(7) of the R. P. Act. On additional issue No. 3, the High Court found that Yashpal Kapur continued to be in the service of the Government of India till January 25, 1971, which was the date of the notification regarding the acceptance of Yashpal Kapur's resignation. The

178. There is, in my opinion, no force in the above submission. The proposition that a member of Parliament cannot claim immunity from being detained under a law relating to preventive detention does not now admit of much doubt. The privileges, powers and the immunities of the members of the two Houses of Indian Parliament as well as of the Indian Legislature are the same as those of the members of the House of Commons as they existed at the time of the commencement of the Constitution. The position about the privileges of the members of the House of Commons as it obtained in the United Kingdom at the relevant time has been stated in Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice. 18th Ed. (p. 100) as under :

""The privilege of freedom from arrest is limited to civil causes, and has not been allowed to interfere with the administration of criminal justice or emergency legislation.""
188. The same, to some extent, appears to be true of part (iv) of clause (4). If the previous law in so far as it relates to the election petitions and matters connected therewith was not to apply to the election of the appellant, the High Court shall be deemed to have had no jurisdiction to decide the election petition challenging the election of the appellant. The effect of part (i) of clause (4) is that the High Court was divested of the jurisdiction to decide the dispute relating to the election of the appellant with a retrospective effect. The law under which the election of the appellant was declared to be void as a result of the amendment was also made inapplicable with retrospective effect to the dispute relating to the election of the appellant. The resultant effect of the amendment thus was that the order by which the election of the appellant was declared to be void and the finding on which such order was based were rendered to be void and no effect.

195. We may now come to part (iii) of clause (4). By part (iii) it is declared that the election of the appellant shall continue to be valid in all respects. Such a declaration would not follow from part (i) of the clause. It would not also follow from part (ii) and part (iv) of the clause which, as mentioned earlier, in effect represented the consequences flowing from part (i). The election to the Lok Sabha of the appellant, who was the Prime Minister, was challenged on the ground that she or her election agents had been guilty of some malpractices. The declaration that her election was to be valid in all respects necessarily involved the process of going into the grounds on which her election had been assailed and holding those grounds to be either factually incorrect or to be of such a nature as in law did not warrant the declaration of her election to be void. The case of the appellant is that some of the grounds mentioned against her were factually incorrect and in respect of those grounds the findings

201. The vice of clause (4) of Article 329A is not merely that it makes the previous law contained in the R. P. Act as amended by Act 58 of 1974 and 40 of 1975 inapplicable to the challenge to the election of the appellant, it also makes no other election law applicable for resolving that dispute. The further vice from which the said clause suffers is that it not merely divests the previous authority, namely, the High Court of its jurisdiction to decide the dispute relating to the election of the appellant, it confers no jurisdiction on some other authority to decide that dispute. Without even prescribing a law and providing a forum for adjudicating upon the grounds advanced by the respondent to challenge the election of the appellant, the constituent authority has declared the election of the appellant to be valid.

205. Another argument advanced in support of the validity of the amendment is that we should take it that the constituent authority constituted itself to be the forum for deciding the dispute relating to the validity of the election of the appellant, and after considering the facts of the case, declared the election of the appellant to be valid. There is, however, nothing before us as to indicate that the constituent authority went into the material which had been adduced before the High Court relating to the validity of the election of the appellant and after considering that material held the election of the appellant to be valid. Indeed, the statement of objects and reasons appended to the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Bill makes no mention of this thing. In any case, the vice of clause (4) would still lie in the fact that the election of the appellant was declared to be valid on the basis that it was not to be governed by any law for settlement of election disputes. Although the provisions of a c

213. As a result of the above, I strike down clause (4) of Article 329A on the ground that it violates the principle of free and fair elections which is an essential postulate of democracy and which in its turn is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution inasmuch as (1) it abolishes the forum without providing for another forum for going into the dispute relating to the validity of the election of the appellant and further prescribes that the said dispute shall not be governed by any election law and the validity of the said election shall be absolute and not consequently be liable to be assailed, and (2) it extinguishes both the right and the remedy to challenge the validity of the aforesaid election.

217. One of the grounds which weighed with the High Court in declaring the election of the appellant to be void was that the appellant committed corrupt practice under the Section 123 (7) of the R. P. Act inasmuch as she obtained and procured the assistance, for the furtherance of her election prospects, of Yaspal Kapur during the period from January 7 to 24, 1971 when Yashpal Kapur was still a gazetted officer in the service of the Government of India.

221. As the appellant filed her nomination paper on February 1, 1971, in view of the amended definition of the word ""candidate"", it would have to be taken that the appellant became a candidate only on February 1, 1971. The result is that even if the finding of the High Court that the appellant obtained and procured the assistance of Yashpal Kapur during the period from January 7 to 24, 1971 were assumed to be correct, the appellant shall not be deemed to have committed corrupt practice under Section 123(7) of the R. P. Act. As regards the assistance of Yashpal Kapur which the appellant is alleged to have obtained and procured after January 14, 1971, the controversy stands resolved also by another amendment. According to the case of the appellant, Yashpal Kapur, tendered his resignation by letter, dated January 13, 1971, with effect from January 14, 1971. The High Court found that Yashpal Kapur continued to be in the service of the Government of India till January 25, 1971 which was the date of the notificati ette of the resignation and termination of the service of a person in the service of the Central Government shall be conclusive proof of his resignation and termination of service and where the date of taking effect of this resignation or termination of service is stated in such publication, also of the fact that such person ceased to be in such service with effect from the said date. Yashpal Kapur in view if the newly added explanation, shall be taken to have ceased to be in government service with effect from January 14, 1971. Any assistance of Yashpal Kapur which the appellant was alleged to have obtained or procured on or after January 14, 1971 would not, therefore, make her guilty of corrupt practice under Section 123(7) of the R. P. Act.

225. We may also before dealing with the validity of Act 40 of 1975 refer to one other change brought about by that Act which has a bearing upon the present case. It was the case of the respondent that the appellant and her election agent made extensive appeals to the religious symbol of cow and calf and thereby committed corrupt practice under Section 123(3) of the R. P. Act. Corrupt practice has been defined in that provision as under :""

(3) The appeal by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent to vote or refrain from voting for any person on the ground of his religion, race, caste, community or language or the case of, or appeal to religious symbols or the use of, or appeal to, national symbols, such as the national flag or the national emblem, for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate.
""It is common case of the parties that the symbol of cow and calf was allotted to the Congress party by the Election Commission. The learned Counsel for the respondent stated during the course of arguments in the High Court that he confined his case only to the use of the symbol of cow and calf. The learned Counsel gave up that part of the case of the respondent wherein it had been alleged that appeals were made to the religious symbol of cow and calf by the appellant. The following proviso has now been inserted in clause (3) of Section 123 by Section 8 of Act 40 of 1975 :""
228. The first such case was State of Orissa v. Bhupendra Kumar Bose (supra). It arose out of elections to the Cuttack Municipality held in December, 1957 to March, 1958 as a result of which 27 appellants were declared elected as councillors. The respondent, who was defeated at the elections, filed a writ petition before the High court challenging the elections. The High Court held that the electoral rolls had not been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Orissa Municipalities Act, 1950, as the age qualification had been published too late thereby curtailing the period of claims and objections to the preliminary roll to 2 days from 21 days as prescribed. The High court consequently set aside the elections. The State took the view that the judgment affected not merely the Cuttack Municipality but other municipalities also. Accordingly, the Governor promulgated an Ordinance validating the elections to the Cuttack Municipality and validating the electoral rolls prepared in respect of various munici""

The Cuttack municipal elections had been set aside by the High Court and if the governor thought that in the public interest, having regard to the factors enumerated in the preamble to the Ordinance, it was necessarily follow that the Ordinance suffers from the vice of contravening Article
14.""
235. The change in the definition of the word ""candidate"" to which our attention has been invited by Mr. Shanti Bhushan does not impinge upon the process of free and fair elections. The fact that as a result of the above change, we have to take into account only the prejudicial activity of the candidate or his election agent from the date of nomination of the candidate and not from the date he holds himself out as a candidate does not affect the process of free and fair elections. It is necessary while dealing with corrupt practice relating to elections to specify the period within which the impugned act, alleged to constitute corrupt practice should have been done. As a result of the amendment, the Legislature has fixed the said period to be as from the date of nomination instead of the period as from the date on which the candidate with the election in prospect began to hold himself out as a prospective candidate. It is common experience that the date from which a candidate holds himself out as a prospecti

240. We may now deal with Cross Appeal No. 909 of 1975. Mr. Shanti Bhushan has not pressed the challenge to the findings of the High Court on issues Nos. 4 and 7. He has, however, assailed the finding of the High Court on issue No., 9 whereby the High Court held that the appellant incurred an expenditure of Rs. 31, 976.47 on her election as against the prescribed limit of Rs. 35, 000. In Ex. 5, return of her election expenses, the appellant showed her total election expenses to be Rs. 12, 892.97. The respondent in para 113 of the election petition alleged that the appellant and her election agent had incurred expenditure much beyond the prescribed limit of Rs. 35, 000 and thereby committed corrupt practice under Section 123(6) of the R. P. Act. The respondent gave some items of the expenditure which were alleged to have been incurred by the appellant and her election agent but were not shown in the return of the election expenses. The material items with which we are now concerned were as under :(i) The hiring charges of the vehicles specified in para 13(1) .. ... over Rs. 1, 28, 700

242. To appreciate the point of controversy between the parties, it may be necessary to set out some material facts. Section 160 of the R. P. Act provides inter alia that if it appears to the State Government that in connection with an election held within the State, any vehicle is needed or is likely to be needed for the purpose of transport of ballot boxes to or from any polling station, or transport of members of the police force for maintaining order during the conduct of such election, or transport of any officer or other person for performance of any duties in connection with such election, the Government may be order in writing requisition such vehicle, provided that no vehicle which is being lawfully used by a candidate or his agent for any purpose connected with the election of such candidate shall be requisitioned until the completion of the poll at such election. It appears that 23 vehicles, described at some places as cars and at other places as jeeps, were requisitioned by the district authoriti ""You are requested to kindly write a letter with your recommendation to the Election Officer so that the cars taken by the District Congress Committee may be released. I have tried to find out Shri Vidyadhar Vajpayee who is contesting the election from Amethi parliamentary constituency and Shri Baiznath Kureel who is contesting the election from Ram Sanehi parliamentary constituency, but they are not available. You are, therefore, requested to write the above letter to the District Election Officer positively so that the election work of all the three parliamentary constituencies which is going on, on behalf of District Congress Committee, may not suffer.""

On February 25, 1971 Yashpal Kapur addressed a letter to the District Officer, Rae Bareli, stating that the 23 vehicles in question had been taken by the District Congress committee, Rae Bareli, for the three parliamentary constituencies of Rae Bareli, Amethi and Ram Sanehi Ghat. The District Officer was requested to release the 23 vehicles without delay. Yashpal Kapur also enclosed with that letter the note of Dal Bahadur Singh. The 23 vehicles, it would appear, were thereafter released by the District Election Officer. The appellant, in para 17(b) of her written statement, admitted that those 23 vehicles were used by the District Congress Committee, Rae Bareli, for election work in the three parliamentary constituencies of Rae Bareli, Amethi and Ram Sanehi Ghat. The High Court, in not accepting the case of the respondent in respect of the 23 vehicles, observed that there was nothing to show that the above mentioned vehicles had been obtained on hire or were obtained gratis. There was also, according to the

MATHEW, J. (concurring) - In the election petition filed by the respondent in Civil Appeal No. 887 of 1975 (hereinafter referred to as 'respondent'), seven charges of corrupt practice were made against the appellant therein (hereinafter called the 'appellant') and it was prayed that the election of the appellant be set aside. The learned Judge who tried the petition found that two of the charges had been made out but that the rest of the charges were not substantiated. He set aside the election of the appellant with the result that the appellant incurred the disqualification for a period of six years as visualized in Section 8A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. It is against this judgment that Civil Appeal No. 887 of 1975 has been filed.

300. In Liyanage v. Queen (supra) the appellants had been charged with offences arising out of an abortive coup d'etat on January 27, 1962. The story of the coup d'etat was set out in a White Paper issued by the Ceylon Government. On March 16, 1962 the Criminal Law (Special Provisions) Act was passed and it was given retrospective effect from January 1, 1962. The Act was limited in operation to those who were accused of offences against the State in or about January 27, 1962. The Act legalised the imprisonment of the appellants while they were awaiting trial, and modified a section of the Penal Code so as to enact ex post facto a new offence to meet the circumstances of the abortive coup. The Act empowered the Minister of Justice to nominate the three judges to try the appellants without a jury. The validity of the Act was challenged as well as the nomination which had been made by the Minister of Justice of the three judges. The Ceylon Supreme Court upheld the objection about the vires of some of the provis

302. At the time when the amendment was passed, the appeal filed by the appellant and the cross appeal of the respondent were pending before the Supreme Court. Clause (4) was legislation ad hominem directed against the course of the hearing of the appeals on merits as the appeal and the cross appeal were to be disposed of in accordance with that clause and not by applying the law to the facts as ascertained by the court. This was a direct interference with the decision of these appeals by the Supreme Court on their merits by a legislative judgment.

307. There is also nothing to show that the amending body validated the election with reference to any change of the law which formed the foundation of the judgment. The cases cited by the Solicitor General to show that a competent Legislature has power to validate an invalid election do not indicate that there can be a validation without changing the law which invalidated the election. Nor do I think that a contested election can be validated without an authority applying the new law to the facts as ascertained by judicial process. If the court which ascertained the facts and applied the law was rendered coram non judice, the facts ascertained by it have ceased to be facts. There are no absolute or immediately evident facts. Only by being first ascertained through legal procedure are facts brought into the sphere of law or, we may say, though it may sound paradoxical, that the competent organ legally created facts. The courts perform a constitutive function in ascertaining facts. There is no fact 'in itself

310. In Abeyesekera v. Jayatilake, the facts were : An order in council of 1923 made provision as to the Legislative Council in Ceylon, but reserved to His Majesty power to revoke, alter or amend the order. The appellant, as common informer, brought an action to recover penalties under the Order from the respondent, who he alleged had sat and voted after his seat had become vacant under its provisions by reason of his having a pecuniary interest in a contract with the Government. In 1928, after the action had been brought but before its trial, an amending Order in Council was made which provided :""

If any such action or legal proceeding has been or shall be instituted, it shall be dismissed and made void, subject to such order as to costs as the Court may think fit to make.
""It also amended the Order of 1923 so as to except the officer held by the respondent from its operation. The Privy Council held that the Order of 1928 was valid, having regard to the power reserved by the Order of 1923, and was an effective defence to the action, although it was retrospective in its operation and that this was no exercise of judicial power. The direction to dismiss must be understood in the light of an earlier provision in the same Order in Council which amended the law on which the proceeding was founded; the dismissal was thus the result of the change in the law and all that the later clause showed was that the change was to have retrospective effect and govern the rights of parties even in pending proceedings. The decision would be helpful here only if an in so far as the provision in clause (4) had followed from a change in any rule of law.
313. In State of Orissa v. Bhupendra Kumar Bose, the facts were as follows : Elections were held for the Cuttack municipality and 27 persons were declared elected as councillors. One B, who defeated at the elections, filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the elections. The High Court held that the electoral rolls had not been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Orissa Municipalities Act, 1950, as the age qualification had been published too late thereby curtailing the period of claims and objections to the preliminary roll to 2 days from 21 days as prescribed; consequently, the High Court set aside the elections. The State took the view that the judgment affected not merely the Cuttack municipality but other municipalities also. Accordingly, the Governor promulgated an Ordinance validating the elections to the Cuttack municipality and validating the electoral rolls prepared in respect of other municipalities. Thereupon, B filed a writ petition before the High Court contending

399. The High Court trying the case had, in the course of a lengthy judgment, rejected the election-petitioner's case on issues Nos. 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 of the first set of issues, after minutely and meticulously scrutinizing every material allegation of the election-petitioner and the evidence given in support of it on each of these issues. Out of these, the election-petitioner, in his Cross Appeal No. 909 of 1975, has questioned the findings of the High Court only on issues Nos. 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 set out above. Issues Nos. 5, 8 and 10, decided in favour of the election- petitioner, were technical and are immaterial now. It will be noticed that the additional issue No. 1, due to some error or oversight, is an exact and unnecessary repetition of the initial issue No. 1. Additional issues numbered 2 and 3 are connected with and subsidiaries of the initially framed issues numbered 1 and 3.",Constitutional Case

On submission of claim for medical reimbursement to the Director, CGH-S, within the stipulated period, was recommended and forwarded vide MHA's letter dated 4.11.1999.

"2. The facts of this case very briefly are that Bharat Rasayan Limited (for short `the assessee') filed a return of income tax claiming a deduction of Rs.72,76,405/- under Section 80HHC of the Act. In the assessment order, the Assessing Officer held that ninety per cent of the gross interest has to be excluded from the profits of the business of the assessee under Explanation (baa) to Section 80HHC of the Act and deducted ninety per cent of the gross interest of Rs.50,26,284/- from the profits of the business of the assessee. The assessee preferred an appeal contending that only ninety per cent of the net interest should have been deducted from the profits of the business of the assessee under Explanation (baa) to Section 80HHC, but the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) rejected this contention of the assessee. Aggrieved, the assessee filed an appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (for short `the Tribunal') and the Tribunal allowed the appeal of the assessee and held that the assessee was entitled to deduct the expenses from the interest received and only ninety per cent of the net amount of interest could be excluded under Explanation (baa) to Section 80HHC and remitted the matter to the Assessing Officer to examine whether there is factually an excess between the interest paid and interest received and take a fresh decision. The Revenue filed an appeal against the order of the Tribunal before the High Court, but by the impugned order the High Court following its decision inCommissioner of Income-Tax v.

"(iii) The Court arrived at the conclusion, that there could not be the slightest doubt that Driver-Constables engaged in the Delhi Police Force, performed the same functions and duties, as other Drivers in the services of the Delhi Administration and the Central Government. Even though he belonged to a different department, the petitioner was held as entitled to the pay-scale of Rs.260-400.

9. Federation of All India Customs and Central Excise Stenographers (Recognized) v. Union of India[3], decided by a two-Judge bench: The petitioners in the above case, were Personal Assistants and Stenographers attached to heads of departments in the Customs and Central Excise Department, of the Ministry of Finance. They were placed in the pay-scale of Rs.550-900. The petitioners claimed, that the basic qualifications, the method, manner and source of recruitment, and their grades of promotion were the same as some of their counterparts (Personal Assistants and Stenographers) attached to Joint Secretaries/Secretaries and other officers in the Central Secretariat. The above counterparts, it was alleged, were placed in the pay-scale of Rs.650-1040. The petitioners’ contention was, that their duties and responsibilities were similar to the duties and responsibilities discharged by some of their counterparts. Premised on the instant foundation, it was their contention, that the differentiation in their pay-scales, was violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The petitioners claimed ‘equal pay for equal work’.

14. State Bank of India v. M.R. Ganesh Babu[8], decided by a three-Judge bench: Entry into the management cadre in banking establishments, is Junior Management Grade Scale-1. The said cadre comprises of Probationary Officers, Trainee Officers and other officers who possess technical skills (specialized officers), such as Assistant Law Officers, Security Officers, Assistant Engineers, Technical Officers, Medical Officers, Rural Development Officers, and other technical posts. All the posts in the Junior Management Grade Scale-1 cadre, were divisible into two categories – generalist officers, and specialist officers. Under the prevalent rules – the 1979 Order, the benefit of a higher starting pay, was extended only to Probationary Officers and Trainee Officers (i.e. to generalist officers), while Rural Development Officers and other specialist officers like Assistant Law Officers, Security Officers, Assistant Engineers etc., were not entitled to a higher starting pay. Rural Development Officers, agitated their claim for similar benefits, as were extended to Probationary Officers and Trainee Officers (i.e. to the generalist officers). The question of viability of the claim raised by Rural Development Officers, was referred to the Bhatnagar Committee. The Bhatnagar Committee made its recommendation, in favour of Rural Development Officers, finding that they were required to shoulder, by and large, the same duties and responsibilities, as Probationary Officers and Trainee Officers, so far as agricultural advances were concerned. The Committee accordingly recommended, that it was a fit case for removal of the anomaly in their salary fitment. It recommended that, Rural Development Officers be allowed the same fitment of salary at the time of appointment, as was extended to Probationary Officers and Trainee Officers (i.e. to the generalist officers). The recommendation made by the Bhatnagar Committee was accepted, and accordingly, Rural Development Officers were extended the same fitment of salary, as generalist officers.

16. Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology v. Manoj K. Mohanty[10], decided by a two-Judge bench: The respondent in the above case, was appointed as a Typist in 1990, on a consolidated salary of Rs.530/- per month, against a vacancy of the post of Junior Assistant. It was his averment, that even though in the appointment order, he was shown to have been appointed against the post of Typist, he had actually been working as a Junior Assistant, in the Examination Section of the institute. In order to demonstrate the aforesaid factual position, the respondent placed reliance on two certificates dated 4.12.1993 and 25.3.1996, issued to him by the Dean of the institute, affirming his stance. Despite the passage of five years since his induction into service, he was paid the same consolidated salary (referred to above), and was also not being regularized. It was also pointed out, that another individual junior to him was regularized against the post of Junior Assistant. The respondent then approached the Orissa High Court by way of a writ petition, seeking appointment on regular basis. The High Court disposed of the said writ petition, by directing, that the respondent be not disengaged from service. The High Court further directed, that the respondent be paid salary in the regular scale of pay admissible to Junior Assistants, with effect from September, 1997. A review petition filed against the High Court’s order dated 11.9.1997, was dismissed. Dissatisfied with the above orders, the Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology approached this Court. While dealing with the question of ‘equal pay for equal work’, this Court, noticed the factual position as under:-

“10. The High Court before directing to give regular pay-scale to the respondent w.e.f. September, 1997 on the principle of “equal pay for equal work” did not examine the pleadings and facts of the case in order to appreciate whether the respondent satisfied the relevant requirements such as the nature of work done by him as compared to the nature of work done by the regularly appointed Junior Assistants, the qualifications, responsibilities etc. When the services of the respondent had not been regularized, his appointment was on temporary basis on consolidated pay and he had not undergone the process for regular recruitment, direction to give regular pay-scale could not be given that too without examining the relevant factors to apply the principle of “equal pay for equal work”. It is clear from the averments made in the writ petition extracted above, nothing is stated as regards the nature of work, responsibilities attached to the respondent without comparing them with the regularly recruited Junior Assistants. It cannot be disputed that there were neither necessary averments in the writ petition nor any material was placed before the High Court so as to consider the application of principle of “equal pay for equal work”.” Based on the fact, that the respondent had not placed sufficient material on the record of the case, to demonstrate the applicability of the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’, this Court set aside the order passed by the High Court, directing that the respondent be paid wages in the regular scale of pay, with effect from September, 1997.
21. Union Territory Administration, Chandigarh v. Manju Mathur[15], decided by a two-Judge bench: In the above matter, the respondents were working as Senior Dieticians and Dieticians in the Directorate of Health Services of the Chandigarh Administration. They were posted in the General Hospital, Chandigarh, under the Union Territory Administration of Chandigarh. They were placed in the pay-scale of Rs.1500-2540 and Rs.1350- 2400, respectively. They moved the Chandigarh Administration, seeking the pay-scale extended to their counterparts, employed in the State of Punjab. The posts against which they were claiming equivalence, were those of Dietician (gazetted) and Dietician (non-gazetted) in the Directorate of Research and Medical Education, Punjab. The posts with which they were seeking equivalence, were sanctioned posts in the Rajindera Hospital (Patiala) and the Shri Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital (Amritsar). These posts were in the pay-scale of Rs.2200-4000 and Rs.1500-2640, respectively. After the State Government declined to accept their claim, they approached the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, which accepted their claim. Dissatisfied with the judgment rendered by the High Court, the Union Territory Administration of Chandigarh, approached this Court.

22. Steel Authority of India Limited v. Dibyendu Bhattacharya[16], decided by a three-Judge bench: The respondent in the above case, was appointed against the post of Speech Therapist/Audiologist, in the Durgapur Steel Plant, in S-6 grade in Medical and Health Services. After serving for a few years, he addressed a representation to the appellant, claiming parity with one B.V. Prabhakar, employed at the Rourkela Steel Plant (a different unit of the same company). The said B.V. Prabhakar was holding the post of E-1 grade in the executive cadre, though designated as Speech Therapist/Audiologist. In his representation, the respondent did not claim parity in pay, but only claimed change of the cadre and upgradation of his post, and accordingly relaxation in eligibility, so as to be entitled to be placed in the pay-scale of posts in E-1 grade.

23. Hukum Chand Gupta v. Director General, Indian Council of Agricultural Research[17], decided by a two-Judge bench: In the above matter, the appellant was originally appointed as a Laboratory Assistant in Group D, in the National Dairy Research Institute. He was promoted as a Lower Division Clerk, after he qualified a limited departmental competitive examination. He was further promoted as a Senior Clerk, again after qualifying a limited departmental competitive examination. At this stage, he was placed in the pay-scale of Rs.1200-2040. He was further promoted to the post of Superintendent in the pay-scale of Rs.1640-2900, yet again, after passing a departmental examination. Eventually, he was promoted as an Assistant Administrative Officer, on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research revised the pay-scales of Assistants, from Rs.1400-2600 to Rs.1640-2900, with effect from 1.1.1986. However, the pay- scale of the post of Superintendent was not revised.

24. National Aluminum Company Limited v. Ananta Kishore Rout[18], decided by a two-Judge bench: The appellant in the above matter, i.e., National Aluminum Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as, NALCO) had established two schools. In the first instance, NALCO itself looked after the management of the said schools. In 1985, it entered into two separate but identical agreements with the Central Chinmoy Mission Trust, Bombay, whereby the management of the schools was entrusted to the above trust. In 1990, a similar agreement was entered into for the management of the above two schools, with the Saraswati Vidya Mandir Society (affiliated to Vidya Bharati Akhila Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan). Accordingly, with effect from 1990, the said Society commenced to manage the affairs of the employees, of the above two schools. Two writ petitions were filed by the employees of the two schools before the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack, seeking a mandamus, that they be declared as employees of NALCO, and be treated as such, with the consequential prayer, that the employees of the two schools be accorded suitable pay-scales, as were admissible to the employees of NALCO. The High Court accepted the above prayers. It is, therefore, that NALCO approached this Court.",Civil Case
"10. They also seek writ of certiorari to quash the orders dated March 12, 1981 appointing the second respondent as Superintending Engineer on ad hoc basis an on regular basis w.e.f. April 10, 1991 as temporary Chief Engineer by order dated November 7, 1994 and orders promoting Harbans Lal and others as Superintending Engineers.

Through the Government Omitted under 1973 Rules reservation in the posts pursuant to which required recruitment by promotion on the principle of seniority subject to rejection of unfit, by the rules issued on March 20, 1974, the Government amended the same and restored recruitment by promotion to the posts on the prescribed percentage. The reservation was limited to those services only where direct recruitment was not more than 50%. The promotion thereafter was to be done according to rules and regulations under those provisions of reservation. The candidates who were eligible and suitable on the basis of seniority and were not found unfit, would be selected upto the reservation limit. Rule 2 of 1974 Rules provides for promotion to the posts where merit was also the consideration. The selected candidates from amongst the Dalits and Tribes and the general candidates would be shown in separate eligibility list to each category. The selected candidates were to be placed according to their inter se seniority of the original post. Afterward, all the three lists were to be compiled according to the inter se seniority and promotion were to be given against the vacancies accordingly and common seniority list was to be maintained. By orders issued on December 27, 1974, it was further clarified that ""after reconsideration, the Government has withdrawn the restriction, i.e., reservation will be limited to those services on where direct recruitment is not more than 50%"". The above referred G.O. Will be treated to be modified accordingly. thus, the Dalits and Tribes were to get reservation in promotion on all posts/services. By proceedings dated July 5, 1984, it was further amplified, vis-a-vis that these order referred to hereinbefore thus: ""The Government after reconsideration feels it necessary to clarify the process of preparation of separate eligibility lists in this regard"".

""Rule 2 of the 1984 order provided that :
""The total vacancies for promotion on the basis of seniority subject to rejection of unfit arises in any department/office at any time shall be divided into general candidates and SC/ST candidates on the basis candidates on the basis of G.Os.
issued from time to time for reservation in promotions for these special categories. Each category shall be prepared separately in the order of their inter se seniority for available vacancies for each category and selection have been done from such eligibility list for each category and selection have been done from such eligibility list for each category on the basis of seniority subject to rejection of unfit. A combined list shall be prepared after selection of candidates form each category according to their inter se seniority.
For ad hoc promotion also the above principle was made applicable. In this legal backdrop, it would thus, be seen that preceding 1990, promotions in State Service where regulated by above instructions and from 1990 Rules, they formed statutory base. The rule of reservation in promotion at all levels has, thus, been provided for the Dalits and Tribes. Under The U.P. Act it was extended to the OBCs only in direct recruitment.
When respondents 2 to 10 were considered and recruited as promotees from the cadre of Executive Engineer to that of Superintending Engineer and above cadres on the basis of merit, the appellants came to challenge their appointments. It was contended in the High Court and reiterated by the learned counsel, M/s. Prag P. Tripathi and Anil Kumar Gupta that in Indira Sawhney & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. [1992 supp. (3) SCC 217] know as Mandal's case, eight of the nine judges, per majority [Ahmadi,j. as he then was, having not participated on this issue] held that appointment by promotion under Articles 16(2) and 16(4) of the Constitution is unconstitutional. In particular, they placed strong reliance on the judgment of jeevan Reddy, J. Speaking for three judges) and Sawant, J. (for himself) in that behalf. They referred to question No. 7 framed by the Bench and contended that the finding has been recorded in paras 859 (7) and 860(8) by Jeevan Reddy, J., in paras 242-431(10) by Pandian, j., In paras 323-24-D by Thommen, J. and Kuldip Singh, J. In para 381, by Sawant, J. in Para 553-553 and by Sahai, J. In paras 623-625. On that premise, it was contended that the 1996 Rules are ultra vires and the promotion of the respondents unconstitutional. It is also contended that having declared the promotions under Articles 16(1) and 16(4) of the constitution as unconstitutional, overruling the judgment of a Bench of five judges of this Court in the General Manager, southern Railway. Rangachari [(1962) 2 SCR 586] the same being not correct in law. Jeevan Reddy, J. with whom Kania, C.J. and Venkatachaliah, J., as he then was, had concurred, and Pandian, J. Having also concurred, expressly overruled prospectively the applicability of the rule of reservation in promotion operative for a period of five year November 16, 1992 i.e. the dare of the judgment. The contention of the petitioners is that it is only a minority view. The ratio, therefore, is unconstitutional. Under Article 145(5) of the Constitution, it does not constitute majority judgment.",Constitutional Case

11. Briefly the facts of the case are that the assessee, as per its object as stated in the Memorandum of Association (MOA), is engaged during the year in two types of business activities (i) generation of electricity from renewable/non conventional sources of energy like wind, solar, biomass, hydro etc. and sale thereof and (ii) assistance to various entrepreneurs for development and generation of electricity through non-conventional sources of energy. For fulfillment of activity no. (ii), the assessee has a dual responsibility in as much as it is a state nodal agency of Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) required to popularize the usage of renewable energy sources (RES) and also a state designated agency required to implement the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 and promote and facilitate energy conservation measures.

& 95,96,87,97,88/JP/16 &125/JP/17 M/s Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd.

16. It was further submitted by the ld AR that due to the expenditure incurred by the assessee on such awareness programme, various entrepreneurs have come to Rajasthan for development and generation of electricity through non-conventional sources of energy from whom the assessee has received registration/processing fees on the plants installed by them which is a part of the receipt of Rs.31.66 crores credited to the P&L a/c. The AO has completely overlooked this revenue stream of the assessee in disallowing the expenditure.

18. In its ground no. 4, the Revenue has challenged the deleting of addition of Rs. 34,29,607/- made by the AO towards expenses on Rural Village Electrification (RVE) 2010-11. The ld AR submitted that the State Government of Rajasthan, as an owner of the assessee, directed it to bear 5% share of the cost of systems and cost on account of replacement of batteries of the 'home lighting systems' under the ""Rural Village Electrification (RVE) 2010-11"" program of Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The object of the program was to provide electrification/lighting through renewable energy sources in un- electrified hamlets of the State of Rajasthan. Accordingly, the assessee, on directions of the State Government of Rajasthan and being a nodal agency of MNRE required to popularize the usage of renewable energy sources incurred expenditure of Rs.34,29,607/- and claimed the same in the P&L a/c.

19. The AO disallowed the expenditure by holding that the expenditure has not been laid out wholly and exclusively in connection with the business of generation of renewable energy or generating electricity from solar/wind-mill.

23. In respect of ground No. 5, the Revenue has challenged the action of the ld CIT(A) in deleting the addition of Rs. 4,12,500/- made by the AO on bio mass fuel supply study expenses. The brief facts of the case are that during the year, Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory & 95,96,87,97,88/JP/16 &125/JP/17 M/s Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd.

Commission (RERC) in the matter of determination of tariff for sale of electricity from Juliflora based bio mass power plants in the State, directed the assessee, being the nodal agency to get the price and price trend of main bio-mass fuel in the State studied/surveyed and to submit a report to it. Accordingly, the assessee issued a work order to Dalkia Energy Service Ltd. for conducting the study. For conducting this study, assessee incurred expenditure of Rs.4,12,500/- on payment to Dalkia Energy Service Ltd. The AO observed that expenditure is capital in nature as assessee will get enduring benefit spread over years for its business on account of such study being a new line of business. Accordingly, he disallowed the claim of the expenditure.

& 95,96,87,97,88/JP/16 &125/JP/17 M/s Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd.

that respect. The case of the appellant is that it is engaged in the business of promotion and development of non conventional energy and renewable energy sources and bio-mass energy is one such energy, the promotion of which has been taken up as part of the State policy. The expenditure on study of biomass is thus an expenditure undertaken as part of development and promotion of renewable energy sources in the State of Rajasthan. Further, the ld CIT(A) has given a finding that based on this study, appellant has issued work orders to various applicants for which it has received application and processing fees and the said finding remain uncontroverted before us. In the result, we are of the view that expenditure on the subject study is an expenditure incurred in the course of carrying out existing business of the assessee company and not in respect of new line of business, being the main contention of the AO to hold the expenditure as capital and enduring in nature. In the result, we upheld the order of the ld CIT(A) and confirm the deletion of subject expenditure. In the result, the subject ground of the revenue's appeal is disallowed.

28. Brief facts of the case are that the assessee follows the mercantile system of accounting. However, as per the Significant & 95,96,87,97,88/JP/16 &125/JP/17 M/s Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd.

29. For the year under consideration, the statutory auditor as per observation No. 7, 9 and 10 of its report stated that assessee should take appropriate action for recovery of extension fees of Rs.16 lacs from M/s Enercon (India) Ltd. (Note No. 7), Rs.55 lacs from M/s Vestas RRB Ltd. (Note No. 9) and Rs.92 lacs from M/s Enercon (India) Ltd. (Note No. 10) as they have not commissioned the project within schedule time. On the basis of these observation, AO observed that extension fees has become due to the assessee and as it is following accrual system of accounting, he made the addition of Rs.1,63,00,000/- (Rs.92 lacs + Rs.55 lacs + Rs.16 lacs). Being aggrieved, the assessee carried the matter in appeal which has deleted the said addition against which the Revenue is in appeal before us.

34. The Ld. CIT(A) after analyzing the expenditure observed that out of the administrative/establishment and other expenses, Rs.2,61,09,810/- pertains directly to the promotional activities of the appellant (income from promotional and other activity is Rs.38,84,12,326/-) and Rs.24,86,561/- is already allocated by the & 95,96,87,97,88/JP/16 &125/JP/17 M/s Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd.

assessee for working out the eligible profit of 80IA units. Accordingly, he held that out of the expenditure of Rs.4,76,62,463/-, after reducing the amount of Rs.2,61,09,810/-, the balance amount of Rs.1,90,68,091/- remains as a common expenditure under the head administrative/establishment and other expenses. He also considered expenditure on payment and provision to employees at Rs.3,02,06,576/- as the common expenditure. The aggregate of these two amounts totaling to Rs.4,92,74,667/- was directed to be apportioned between the turnover of power generating units to the total turnover of the assessee to work out the profit eligible for deduction u/s 80IA(4). He did not accept the contention of the assessee that no part of these expenditure can be allocated to the power generating business as the same has been outsourced. In respect of the income of Rs.22,83,281/- on account of shortfall in the generation, which is excluded by the AO for calculation of eligible profit u/s 80IA(4), no finding is given by the Ld. CIT(A). The relevant finding of the ld CIT(A) are reproduced as under:-

""7.3 I have perused the facts of the case, the assessment order and the submission of the appellant. The Assessing Officer observed that the assessee had deducted only direct expenditure in relation to sales from generation of electricity while claiming deduction u/s 80IA(4). The Assessing Officer held that indirect expenses in the nature of ""payments and provisions for employees"" amounting to Rs. 4,76,62,463/- and administrative, establishment and other expenses amount to Rs. 3,02,06,576/- had also to be deducted on a proportionate basis from the sales to arrive at the correct computation of profits & gains derived from this industrial undertaking for determining the correct deduction u/s 80IA(4). It has been stated byt he appellant that out of administrative establishment and other expenses of Rs.
& 95,96,87,97,88/JP/16 &125/JP/17 M/s Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd.
3,02,06,576/-; an amount of Rs. 24,84,561/- pertain directly to power projects and has been deducted accordingly, Further expenditure of Rs. 2,61,09,810/- on biomass fuel supply discount, IEC plan expenses, expenses relating to rural village electrification ( RVE), energy conservation contribution expenses pertain directly to the promotional activities of the appellant and cannot be apportioned on proportionate basis with power generation activity. This contention of the appellant is acceptable. Thereafter an amount of Rs. 1,90,68,091/- remains as the common expenditure under the head 'administrative/ establishment expenses' along with payment and provision to employees of Rs. 3,02,06,576/-. The above two expenditures totaling Rs. 4,92,74,667/-, needs to be apportioned between the power generation activities and promotional activities of the appellant. The contention of the appellant that this common expenditure is not relatable to the power generation business since it has been outsourced is not acceptable because these are indirect expenses in the nature of employee costs and administration, establishment expenses which would have been incurred for both the business of the appellant. The alternate submission of the appellant that this expenditure can be attributed to the power generation business only to the extent of 5% is without any basis. Also, the contention that this expenditure can be apportioned on gross profit basis is not correct because the appellant has not included depreciation while calculating he gross profit on cash basis. Therefore, the only reasonable basis for apportioning this expenditure is on the basis of turnover, as has been done by the Assessing Officer with the only difference being that this apportionment is to be done on common expenditure amounting to Rs. 4,92,74,667/-. This ground is partly allowed.""
38. So far as expenditure of Rs.4,76,62,462/- under the head administrative/establishment and other expenses is concerned, it was submitted that the Ld. CIT(A) rightly excluded the expenditure of Rs.2,85,94,371/- comprising of Rs.24,84,561/- which the assessee itself considered in working out the profit of power units and Rs.2,61,09,810/- which is directly related to the promotional and other & 95,96,87,97,88/JP/16 &125/JP/17 M/s Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd.

49. Brief facts of the case are that the Government of Rajasthan, as an owner of the assessee, directed it to contribute Rs.2 crores towards construction of 'Rajasthan Bhawan' at Mumbai. The Board of Directors of the company, accordingly resolved in its 65th Board meeting dated 13.12.2010 to provide an amount of Rs.2 crores for construction of & 95,96,87,97,88/JP/16 &125/JP/17 M/s Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd.

67. Brief facts of the case are that the assessee claimed deduction u/s 80-IA(4) in respect of its power generating undertakings at Rs.17,67,94,304/-. In the original assessment proceedings, claim was allowed. However, the case was reopened u/s 147 on the ground that assessee has claimed deduction u/s 80-IA on income such as shortfall in generation, low generation & stock of Carbon Financial Instruments Rs.2,73,48,665/- and other receipts of Rs.62,45,945/- by incorrectly treating it as profit derived from eligible business and has not apportioned various head office and other day-to-day management & supervision expenses amongst the units claiming u/s 80-IA of the Act.",Administrative Case
"3. Briefly stated the facts are that the assessee had let out a commercial space on an annual rent of Rs. 25,30,800/- and has also received an amount of Rs. 25,30,800/- as interest free security. The Assessing Officer was of the opinion that the security deposit received by the assessee was an advantage accruing to the assessee as a result of letting out of the property so it was to be taken into consideration for determining the ALV of the property in terms of Section 23 of the Income Tax Act. Thereafter, the Assessing Officer worked out the ALV of the property and enhanced the same by adding interest @ 15% on the average value of security deposit of Rs. 19,09,623/- and made the impugned addition of Rs. 2,86,443/- by relying upon the decision of ITAT Bombay Bench in the case of CIT v. Rati Agnihotri in ITA No. 6826 BOL/80A and 8824/Del/90 wherein the Tribunal held that interest on security deposit had to be added to the actual rent received in order to arrive at ALV of the property.",Administrative Case
"3. The brief facts of the case are that the assessee is engaged in construction of a mall at Nagpur. A search and seizure action u/s 132 of the Act was carried out on 20th January, 2012 at the offices of Provogue India Ltd. and residence of its directors, etc.. The search was concluded on 17th March, 2012. During the course of search of the office premises of Provogue (India) Ltd. Located at 105/106, Provogue House, loose papers from serial no. 9 to 32 were found and seized , which were trial balances of following three companies:-

4 ITA 1306/Mum/2015,1540/Mum/2015, 1308/Mum/2015 and 1539/Mum/2015 `(i) Alliance Mall Developers Co. Pvt. Ltd.
      (ii)    Hagwood Commercial Developers P. Ltd.
      (iii)   Empire Mall Pvt. Ltd.



The Revenue invoked Section 153C of the Act after satisfaction note has been recorded against the assessee company, as the documents belonging to the assessee company had been seized in the search action in the case of M/s Provogue (India) Limited. Notices dated 13-08-2013 were issued to the assessee u/s 153A r.w.s. 153C of the Act . The assessee filed return of income on 22-08-2013 declaring income of Rs.13,29,532/- which included undisclosed income of Rs. NIL. The AO , thereafter , issued notices u/s 143(2) on 23.08.2013 which was duly served on the assessee which was followed with notices u/s 142(1)of the Act along with detailed questionnaire.
m) The assessee further submits that even as per S. 37 read with 43(2) of the Income-Tax Act, expenses incurred during the year have to be allowed as deduction. The above referred expenses have been incurred during the year and are allowable as deduction.

(iv) It is evident from the above-referred notes to account forming part of audited annual accounts of the assessee reproduced above that the assessee is not a builder & developer. The assessee is actually constructing a capital asset and that is why, the expenditure incurred by it have been classified under the head 'Capital Work-in-Progress' forming part of 'Fixed Assets' in the Balance Sheet. Notwithstanding the assessee classifying the rent and other receipts from the impugned mall on its completion, under the head 'Income from House Property' or under the head 'Profit & Gains from Business or Profession', the mall will remain a capital asset and not its stock-in-trade. The other details filed during the course of assessment proceedings on 19.09.2013 also confirms that the assessee is neither a builder & developer engaged in developing real estate for sale to consumers nor a contractor engaged in construction activity. Therefore, the claim of the assessee that AS-7 and AS-9 apply to the facts of the assessee is not correct. In its books of account the assessee itself is showing the construction expenses incurred as capital work-in-progress and not as work-in-progress forming part of Inventory or stock-in-trade.",Administrative Case
"4. Brief facts which are necessary to dispose of this appeal are recapitulated as under:

The appellant, who belongs to the Indian National Congress party (for short `Congress party') is the alleged accused in this case. The case of the prosecution, as disclosed in the First Information Report (for short `FIR'), is that Sidramappa Patil was contesting election of the State assembly on behalf of the Bhartiya Janata Party (for short `BJP'). In the FIR, it is incorporated that Baburao Patil, Prakash Patil, Mahadev Patil, Mallikarjun Patil, Apparao Patil, Yeshwant Patil were supporters of the Congress and so also the supporters of the appellant Siddharam Mhetre and opposed to the BJP candidate.
7. According to the prosecution, the appellant along with his brother instigated their party workers which led to killing of Bhima Shanker Kora. It may be relevant to mention that the alleged incident took place after eight days of the alleged incident of instigation.

15. It is apparent from the Statement of Objects and Reasons for introducing section 438 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 that it was felt imperative to evolve a device by which an alleged accused is not compelled to face ignominy and disgrace at the instance of influential people who try to implicate their rivals in false cases.

"2. On 7-1-1994 at about 12.55 p.m., the brother of the petitioner being apprehensive of the intentions of Respondent 4, sent a telegram to the Chief Minister of U.P. apprehending his brother's implication in some criminal case and also further apprehending the petitioner being shot dead in fake encounter.

3. In spite of the frequent enquiries, the whereabouts of the petitioner could not be located. On the evening of 7-1- 1994, it came to be known that petitioner is detained in illegal custody of 5th respondent, SHO, P.S. Mussoorie.

4. On 8-1-1994, it was informed that the 5th respondent was keeping the petitioner in detention to make further enquiries in some case. So far the petitioner has not been produced before the Magistrate concerned. Instead the 5th respondent directed the relatives of the petitioner to approach the 4th respondent SSP, Ghaziabad, for release of the petitioner.

7. The said Senior Superintendent of Police along with petitioner appeared before this Court on 14-1-1994. According to him, the petitioner has been released. To question as to why the petitioner was detained for a period of five days, he would submit that the petitioner was not in detention at all. His help was taken for detecting some cases relating to abduction and the petitioner was helpful in cooperating with the police. Therefore, there is no question of detaining him. Though, as on today the relief in habeas corpus petition cannot be granted yet this Court cannot put an end to the writ petition on this score. Where was the need to detain the petitioner for five days; if really the petitioner was not in detention, why was not this Court informed are some questions which remain unanswered. If really, there was a detention for five days, for what reason was he detained? These matters require to be enquired into. Therefore, we direct the learned District Judge, Ghaziabad to make a detailed enquiry and submit his report within four weeks from the date of receipt of this order.",Criminal Case
"3 In his complaint dated 18 June 2016, the second respondent stated that certain land admeasuring 17 vigha comprised in survey 1408 at Panakhan Gokulnagar in Jamnagar city was his ancestral agricultural land. The land was converted to non-agricultural use on 21 June 1995 and 5 January 2000 pursuant to orders of the District Collector. One hundred and three plots were carved out of the land. Amongst them, plots 45 to 56 admeasuring 32,696 sq.ft. were in the joint names of six brothers and a sister (represented by the complainant). According to the complainant, a broker by the name of Bachhubhai Veljibhai Nanda approached him with Parbatbhai Ahir, the first appellant stating that he desired to purchase the land. On the next day, the first appellant approached the complainant with his partner Hasmukhbhai Patel (the third appellant) to purchase the land. The complainant was requested to provide a photocopy of the lay out plan of the plot, which he did. On the following day the first appellant is alleged to have gone to the house of the complainant with the second and the third appellants at which point in time, parties agreed that the land would be sold at the rate of Rs 4,221 per sq.ft. and a deal was struck for a consideration of Rs.1,13,58,711/- out of which an amount of Rs 11 lakhs was given in cash to the complainant for plot no.56. The complainant’s case is that while the discussion was on, he was requested by the second and the third appellants that since the power of attorney was old and unreadable all the plot holders should give their passport size photographs. Accordingly, a document was reduced to writing by which it was agreed that the sale transaction for plot no.56 would be completed within two months against full payment. According to the complainant, when he demanded the remaining payment for the plot from the second and third appellants, the second appellant provided him seven cheques each in the amount of Rs 6 lakhs in the name of the six brothers (one brother being given two cheques). Thereafter when the complainant followed up for the payment of the remaining amount with the purchasers, the balance was not paid and, on the contrary, the complainant was threatened of a forcible transfer of the land. According to the complainant, when he visited the office of the Sub-registrar about three days before lodging the complaint, it came to his knowledge that a sale deed has been registered not only in respect of the plot in question (which was agreed to be sold) but also in respect of plot nos.45 to 55 on 27 January 2016. It was then that the complainant realised that the purchaser in the sale deed was shown as the fourth appellant, Jayesh Arvindbhai Patel, and the name of the seventh appellant, Jitudan Nankudan Gadhavi, resident of Payalnagar society, Naroda, Ahmedabad was shown as the holder of a power of attorney. The witnesses to the registered sale deed were the fifth appellant, Rabari Hiteshbhai and the sixth appellant, Patel Indravaden Dineshbhai.

4 The complaint came to be lodged on the complainant having realised that the power of attorney in the name of his siblings had been forged. The complainant stated that neither he nor any of his siblings had given a power of attorney in favour of the seventh appellant. According to the complainant, neither the non-judicial stamp dated 25 January 2016 in the amount of Rs 10,30,000/- nor the judicial stamp dated 27 January 2016 has been purchased by him. In fact, according to the complainant, it was the fourth appellant who had purchased the judicial stamp dated 27 January 2016. 5 According to the complaint, plots no.45 to 55 admeasuring 30,005 sq.ft. are valued at Rs 12.50 crores. It has been alleged that a conspiracy was hatched by the appellants and by the other co-accused resulting into the transfer of valuable land belonging to the complainant and his siblings, on the basis of forged documents.",Criminal Case
"3. Before addressing the legal question, it would be apt to survey the facts leading up to the present litigation. Admittedly, both the appellant-accused and the respondent- claimant are residents of Ranebennur, Karnataka. The appellant-accused is a mechanic who had engaged the services of the respondent-complainant who is a Civil Engineer, for the purpose of supervising the construction of his house in Ranebennur. The said construction was completed on 20-10- 1998 and this indicates that the parties were well acquainted with each other.

4. As per the respondent-complainant, the chain of facts unfolded in the following manner. In October 1998, the accused had requested him for a hand loan of Rs. 45,000 in order to meet the construction expenses. In view of their acquaintance, the complainant had paid Rs. 45,000 by way of cash. On receiving this amount, the appellant-accused had initially assured repayment by October 1999 but on the failure to do so, he sought more time till December 2000. The accused had then issued a cheque bearing No. 0886322, post-dated for 8-2-2001 for Rs. 45,000 drawn on Syndicate Bank, Kudremukh Branch. Consequently, on 8-2-2001, the complainant had presented this cheque through Karnataka Bank, Ranebennur for encashment. However, on 16-2-2001 the said Bank issued a return memo stating that the `Payment has been stopped by the drawer' and this memo was handed over to the complainant on 21-2-2001. The complainant had then issued notice to the accused in this regard on 26-2-2001. On receiving the same, the accused failed to honour the cheque within the statutorily prescribed period and also did not reply to the notice sent in the manner contemplated under Section 138 of the Act. Following these developments, the complainant had filed a complaint (under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) against the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act.

5. The appellant-accused had raised the defence that the cheque in question was a blank cheque bearing his signature which had been lost and that it had come into the hands of the complainant who had then tried to misuse it. The accused's case was that there was no legally enforceable debt or liability between the parties since he had not asked for a hand loan as alleged by the complainant.",Criminal Case
"3. Briefly stated facts are that the assessee in the present case is a limited company and engaged in the manufacturing and marketing business of pharmaceuticals business. The TPO during the proceedings found that assessee has provided guarantee on loan taken by its Associated Enterprises.

""6. The allegations against accused Sanjay Chandra are that he entered into criminal conspiracy with accused A. Raja, R.K. Chandolia and other accused persons during September 2009 to get UAS licence for providing telecom services to otherwise an ineligible company to get UAS licences. He, as Managing Director of M/s Unitech Wireless (Tamil Nadu) Limited, was looking after the business of telecom through 8 group companies of Unitech Limited. The first-come-first-
served procedure of allocation of UAS Licences and spectrum was manipulated by the accused persons in order to benefit M/s Unitech Group Companies. The cutoff date of 25.09.2007 was decided by accused public servants of DoT primarily to allow consideration of Unitech group applications for UAS licences. The Unitech Group Companies were in business of realty and even the objects of companies were not changed to `telecom' and registered as required before applying. The companies were ineligible to get the licences till the grant of UAS licences. The Unitech Group was almost last within the applicants considered for allocation of UAS licences and as per existing policy of first-come-first-served, no licence could be issued in as many as 10 to 13 circles where sufficient spectrum was not  available. The Unitech companies got benefit of spectrum in as many as 10 circles over the other eligible applicants. Accused Sanjay Chandra, in conspiracy with accused public servants, was aware of the whole design of the allocation of LOIs and on behalf of the Unitech group companies was ready with the drafts of Rs. 1658 crores as early as 10th October, 2007.""

9. It was further alleged that M/s Swan Telecom Pvt. Ltd. (STPL) was, at the time of application dated 02.03.2007, an associate of M/s Reliance ADA Group / M/s Reliance Communications Limited / M/s Reliance Telecom Limited, having existing UAS Licences in all telecom circles. Investigations have also disclosed that M/s Tiger Traders Pvt. Ltd., which held majority stake (more than 90%) in M/s Swan Telecom Pvt. Ltd. (STPL), was also an associate company of Reliance ADA Group. Both the  companies has not business history and were activated solely for the purpose of applying for UAS Licences in 13 telecom circles, where M/s Reliance Telecom Ltd. did not have GSM spectrum and M/s Reliance Communications Ltd. had already applied for dual technology spectrum for these circles. Investigation has disclosed that the day to day affairs of M/s Swan Telecom Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Tiger Traders Pvt. Ltd. were managed by the said three accused persons either themselves or through other officers/consultants related to the Reliance ADA group. Commercial decisions of M/s Swan Telecom Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Tiger Traders Pvt. Ltd. were also taken by these accused persons of Reliance ADA group. Material inter-company transactions (bank transactions) of M/s Reliance Communications / M/s Reliance Telecommunications Ltd. and M/s Swan Telecom Pvt.

10. Investigations about the holding structure of M/s Tiger Traders Pvt. Ltd. has revealed that the aforesaid accused persons also structured two other companies i.e. M/s Zebra Consultancy Private Limited & M/s Parrot Consultants Private  Limited. Till April, 2007, by when M/s Swan Telecom Pvt. Ltd. applied for telecom licences, 50% shares of M/s Zebra Consultancy Private Limited & M/s Parrot Consultants Private Limited, were purchased by M/s Tiger Traders Pvt. Ltd.

Similarly, 50% of equity shares of M/s Parrot Consultants Private Limited & M/s Tiger Traders Private Limited were purchased by M/s Zebra Consultancy Private Limited.

It is alleged that TRAI in its recommendations dated 28.08.2007 recommended the use of dual technology by UAS Licencees. Due to this reason M/s Reliance Communications Limited, holding company of M/s Reliance Telecom  Limited, became eligible to get GSM spectrum in telecom circles for which STPL had applied.

Consequently, having management control of STPL was of no use for the applicant/accused persons and M/s Reliance Telecom Limited.

"6 Hadiya is a major. Twenty four years old, she is pursuing a course of studies leading up to a degree in Homoeopathic medicine and surgery at a college in Salem in Tamil Nadu. She was born to parents from the Ezhava Community. In January 2016, Asokan instituted a habeas corpus petition, stating that Hadiya was missing. During the course of the proceedings, Hadiya appeared before the Kerala High Court and asserted that she had accepted Islam as a faith of choice. From 7 January 2016, she resided at the establishment of Sathyasarani Education Charitable Trust at Malappuram. On 19 January 2016, the Kerala High Court categorically observed that Hadiya was not under illegal confinement after interacting with her and permitted her to reside at the Sathyasarani Trust premises. Nearly seven months later, Asokan filed another petition in the nature of habeas corpus alleging that Hadiya had been subjected to forced conversion and was likely to be transported out of India.

7 During the course of the proceedings, the High Court interacted with Hadiya. She appeared in the proceedings represented by an advocate. Hadiya, as the High Court records, declined to accompany her parents and expressed a desire to continue to reside at Sathyasarani. The High Court initially issued a direction that she should be “accommodated in a ladies’ hostel at the expense of her father”. On 27 September 2016, Hadiya made a serious grievance of being in the custody of the court for thirty five days without being able to interact with anyone. She stated that she had no passport and the allegation that she was likely to go to Syria was incorrect. Based on her request, the High Court directed her to reside at the Sathyasarani establishment. The High Court heard the case on 24 October 2016, 14 November 2016 and 19 December 2016. On 21 December 2016, the High Court was informed that Hadiya had entered into a marriage on 19 December 2016. The High Court recorded its “absolute dissatisfaction at the manner in which the marriage if at all one has been performed has been conducted”.",Constitutional Case
"7. In Civil Appeal Nos.3595-3612 of 1999 the respondents therein who were temporarily engaged on daily wages in the Commercial Taxes Department in some of the districts of the State of Karnataka claim that they worked in the department based on such engagement for more than 10 years and hence they are entitled to be made permanent employees of the department, entitled to all the benefits of regular employees. They were engaged for the first time in the years 1985-86 and in the teeth of orders not to make such appointments issued on 3.7.1984. Though the Director of Commercial Taxes recommended that they be absorbed, the Government did not accede to that recommendation. These respondents thereupon approached the Administrative Tribunal in the year 1997 with their claim. The Administrative Tribunal rejected their claim finding that they have not made out a right either to get wages equal to that of others regularly employed or for regularization. Thus, the applications filed were dismissed. The respondents approached the High Court of Karnataka challenging the decision of the Administrative Tribunal. It is seen that the High Court without really coming to grips with the question falling for decision in the light of the findings of the Administrative Tribunal and the decisions of this Court, proceeded to order that they are entitled to wages equal to the salary and allowances that are being paid to the regular employees of their cadre in government service with effect from the dates from which they were respectively appointed. It may be noted that this gave retrospective effect to the judgment of the High Court by more than 12 years. The High Court also issued a command to the State to consider their cases for regularization within a period of four months from the date of receipt of that order. The High Court seems to have proceeded on the basis that, whether they were appointed before 01.07.1984, a situation covered by the decision of this Court in Dharwad District Public Works Department vs. State of Karnataka (1990 (1) SCR 544) and the scheme framed pursuant to the direction thereunder, or subsequently, since they have worked for a period of 10 years, they were entitled to equal pay for equal work from the very inception of their engagement on daily wages and were also entitled to be considered for regularization in their posts.

"27. Taking first the challenge to the Proclamation issued by the President on 21.4.1989 dismissing the Government of Karnataka and dissolving the State Assembly, the Proclamation does not contain any reasons and merely recites that the President is satisfied on a consideration of the report of the Governor and other information received by him, that the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The facts were that the Janata Party being the majority party in the State Legislature had formed Government under the leadership of Shri S.R. Bommai on 30.8.1988 following the resignation on 1.8.1988 of the earlier Chief Minister, Shri Hegde who headed the Ministry from March 1985 till his resignation. In September 1988, the Janata Party and Lok Dal [B] merged into a new party called Janata Dal. The Ministry was expanded on 15.4.1989 with addition of 13 members. Within two days thereafter, i.e., on 17.4.1989, one Shri K.R. Molakery, a legislator of Janata Dal defected from the party and presented a letter to the Governor withdrawing his support to the Ministry. On the next day, he presented to the Governor 19 letters allegedly signed by 17 Janata Dal legislators, one independent but associate legislator and one legislator belonging to the Bhartiya Janata Party which was supporting the Ministry, withdrawing their support to the Ministry. On receipt of these letters, the Governor is said to have called the Secretary of the Legislature Department and got the authenticity of the signatures on the said letters verified. On 19.4.1989, the Governor sent a report to the President stating therein that there were dissensions in the Janta Party which had led to the resignation of Shri Hegde and even after the formation of the new party, viz., Janata Dal, there were dissensions and defections. In support of his case, he referred to the 19 letters received by him. He further stated that in view of the withdrawal of the support by the said legislators, the chief Minister, Shri Bommai did not command a majority in the Assembly and, hence, it was inappropriate under the Constitution, to have the State administered by an Executive consisting of Council of Ministers which did not command the majority in the House. He also added that no other political party was in a position to form the Government. He, therefore, recommended to the President that he should exercise power under Article 356[1]. It is not disputed that the Governor did not ascertain the view of Shri Rommai either after the receipt of the nineteen letters or before making his report to the President. On the next day, i.e., 20.4.1989. seven out of the nineteen legislators who had allegedly written the said letters to the Governor sent letters to him complaining that their signatures were obtained on the earlier letters by misrepresentation and affirmed their support to the Ministry. The State Cabinet met on the same day and decided to convene the Session of the Assembly within a week i.e., on 27.4.1989. The Chief Minister and his Law Minister met the Governor the same day and informed him about the decision to summon the Assembly Session. It is also averred in the petition that they had pointed out to the Governor the recommendation of the Sarkaria Commission that the strength of the Ministry should be tested on the floor of the House. The Chief Minister also offered to prove has majority on the floor of the House even by proponing the Assembly Session, if needed. To the same effect, he sent a telex message to the President. The Governor, however sent yet another report to the President on the same day i.e., 20-4-1989, in particular, referring to the letters of seven members pledging their support to the Ministry and withdrawing their earlier letters. He, however, opined in the report that the letters from the seven legislators were obtained by the Chief Minister by pressurising them and added that horse-trading was going on and atmosphere was getting vitiated. In the end, he reiterated his opinion that the Chief Minister had lost the confidence of the majority in the House and repeated his earlier request for action under Article 356[1]. On that very day, the President issued the Proclamation in question with the recitals already referred to above. The Proclamation was, thereafter approved by the Parliament as required by Article 356[3], Shri Bommai and some other members of the Council of Ministers challenged the validity of the Proclamation before the Karnataka High Court by a writ petition on various grounds. The petition was resisted by the Union of India, among others. A three-Judge Bench of the High Court dismissed the petition holding, among other things, that the facts stated in the Governor's report could not be held to be irrelevant and that the Governor's satisfaction that no other party was in a position to form the Government had to be accepted since his personal bona fides were not questioned and his satisfaction was based upon reasonable assessment of all the relevant facts. The Court also held that recourse to floor-test was neither compulsory nor obligatory and was not a pre-requisite to sending the report to the President. It was also held that the Governor's report could not be challenged on the ground of legal mala fides since the Proclamation had to be issued on the satisfaction of the Union Council of Ministers. The Court further relied upon the test laid down in the State of Rajasthan case [supra] and held that on the basis of the material disclosed, the satisfaction arrived at by the President could not be faulted.

Following appeals of some organisations including the BJP, thousands of kar sevaks from Uttar Pradesh as well as from other States including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh gathered near the Ram Janam Bhumi-Babri Masjid structure on the 6th December, 1992 and eventually some of them demolished the disputed structure. Following the demolition, on the same day the Uttar Pradesh Government resigned. Thereafter, on the same day the President issued Proclamation under Article 356[1] and dissolved the Legislative Assembly of the State. The said Proclamation in not challenged. Hence we are not concerned in these proceedings with its validity.

As a result of the demolition of the structure which was admittedly a mosque standing at the site for about 400 years, there were violent reactions in this country as well as in the neighbouring countries where some temples were destroyed. This in turn created further reactions in this country resulting in violence and destruction of the property. The Union Government tried to cope up with the situation by taking several steps including a ban on several organisations including Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh [RSS], Vishva Hindu Parishad [VHP] Bajrang Dal which had along with BJP given a call for kar sevaks to march towards Ayodhya on 6th December, 1992. The ban order was issued on 10th December, 1992 under under the Unlawful Activities [Prevention] Act, 1967. The dismissal of the State Governments and the State Legislative Assemblies in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh were admittedly a consequence of these developments and were effected by the issuance of Proclamations under Article 356[1], all on the 15th December, 1992.

In the counter to the writ petition in the Madhya Pradesh High Court, the case of the Union of India inter alia, was that the Proclamation is issued on the satisfaction of the President that government of Madhya Pradesh cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The reports of the Governor disclosed that the State Government had miserably failed to protect the citizens and property of the State against internal disturbance. On the basis of the said reports, the President formed the requisite satisfaction. The Proclamation under Clause (1) has been approved by both Houses of Parliament. In such a situation the Court ought not to entertain the writ petition to scrutinise the wisdom or otherwise of the Presidential Proclamation or of the approval of the Parliament.

In the counter affidavit filed in the writ petition (T.C. 8/93) relating to Himachal Pradesh, it is stated that the events of 6th December, 1992 were not the handiwork of few persons. It is ""the public attitude and statements of various groups and political parties including BJP which led to the destruction of the structure in question and caused great damage to the very secular fabric of the country and created communal discord and disharmony all over the country including Himachal Pradesh."" It is stated that the repercussions of the event cannot be judged by comparing the number of persons killed in different States. It is asserted that the Council of Ministers and the President ""had a wealth of material available to them in the present case which are relevant to the satisfaction formed under Article 356. They were also aware of the serious damage to communal amity and harmony which has been caused in the State of Madhya Pradesh, among others. They were extremely concerned with repercussions which events at Ayodhya might still have in the States"" and ""the ways and means to bring back normally not only in the law and order situation but also communal amity and harmony which had been so badly damaged as a result of the activities, attitude and stand of inter alia the party in power in the State."" It is also stated that, according to the definite information available to the Government of India, members of the RSS were not only present on the spot at Ayodhya but actually participated in the demolition and they were responsible for promotion of communal disharmony. It is also asserted that the action was taken by the President not only on the basis of the report of the Governor but also on the basis of other information received by him.

192. In March, 1990, Hill Peoples' Union, to which the petitioner, Gonald Stone Massar, belonged and several other State political parties and certain independent M.L.As. joined together to form a 'front', known as Meghalaya United Parliamentary Party (MUPP). This Front had a majority in the Assembly and formed the government headed by Sri B.B. Lyngdoh. On July 25, 1991, the then Speaker of the House, Sri P.R. Kyndiah Arthree was elected as the leader of the opposition group known as United Meghalaya Parliamentary Forum (UMPF), which was led by the Congress party to which Sri Kyndiah belonged. He claimed the support of the majority of members in the House and requested the Governor to invite him to form the Government. Thereupon the Governor requested Sri Lyngdoh to prove his majority on the floor of the House. On August 7, 1991, a special session of the Assembly was convened to pass a motion of confidence in the ministry. On the motion being moved, thirty members supported it and twenty seven voted against it. Before announcing the result, however, the Speaker announced that he had received a complaint against five independent M.L.As. in the ruling coalition alleging disqualification under the Anti-defection Law and that he was forthwith suspending their right to vote. This resulted in an uproar in the Assembly. The session had to be adjourned. On August 11, 1991. the Speaker sent identical show-cause notices to the said five independent MLAs on the basis of the complaint filed by one Sri H.S. Shylla. On August 16, the five MLAs sent their replies denying that they have joined any of the parties as alleged. They affirmed that they continue to remain independents. On August 17, 1991 the Speaker passed on order disqualifying all the five MLAs on the basis that four of them were ministers in the Lyngdoh ministry and one of them (Sri Chamberlain Marak) was the Deputy Government Chief Whip. The disqualification, it may be noted, was not on the ground alleged in the show cause notice.

215. The reports of the Governor disclosed that the State Government had miserably failed to protect the citizens and property of the State against internal disturbance. On the basis of the said reports, the President formed the requisite satisfaction.

233. In S.R. Bhommai's appeal the facts are that on March 5, 1985 elections held to the Karnataka State Legislative Assembly and the Janta Dal won 139 seats out of 225 seats and the Congress Party was the next largest party securing 66 seats. Sri R.K. Hedge was elected as the leader of Janta Dal and became the Chief Minister. Due to his resignation on August 12, 1988, Sri S.R. Bhommai's was elected as leader of the party and became the Chief Minister. As on February 1, 1989 the strength of Janta Dal was 111 and the Congress was 65 and Janta Party was 27, apart from others. On April 15, 1989 his expanding the Ministry caused dissatisfaction to some of the aspirants. One Kalyan Molakery and others defected form Janta Dal and he wrote letters on April 17 and 18, 1989 to the Governor enclosing the letters of 19 others expressing want of confidence in Sri Bhommai. On April 19, 1989 the Governor of Karnataka sent a report to the President. On April 20, 1989, 7 out of 19 M.L.As. that supported Kalyan Molakery, wrote to the Governor that their signatures were obtained by misrepresentation and reaffirmed their support to Sri Bommai. On the same day the cabinet also decided to convene the Assembly session on April 27, 1989 at 3.30 P.M. to obtain vote of confidence and Sri Bommai met the Governor and requested him, to allow floor test to prove his majority and he was prepared even to advance the date of the session. In this scenario the Governor sent his second report to the President and exercising the power under Article. 356 the President issued proclamation, dismissed Bhommai Government and dissolved the Assembly on April 21, 1989 and assumed the administration of the State of Karnataka. When a writ petition was filed on April 26, 1989, a special bench of three Judges of the High Court of Karnataka dismissed the writ petition (reported in S.R. Bhommai and Ors. v. Union of India AIR (1990) Karnataka p.5. Thus this appeal by special leave.",Constitutional Case
"3. The facts leading to this appeal are, that an FIR was lodged against the respondents herein and two unknown persons at Police Station Raun, District Bhind, for the offences punishable under Sections 307 and 34 of the IPC, which was registered as Crime No.36/13. It was alleged that on 03.03.2013 at about 9:30 p.m., the complainant – Charan Singh, who is an operator of LNT machine is extracting sand of Sindh River at Indukhi Sand Mine and at that time firing from other side of river started and the counter firing from this side also started then he heard that take away your machine from here. It is alleged that some people came there from which Sanjeev (respondent no.2 herein), Lature (respondent no.1 herein), Sant Singh (respondent no.3 herein) and two unknown persons came near to the complainant and his machine and told him to run away, then somebody told to Sanjeev (respondent no.2 herein) to fire and then Sanjeev fired on the complainant and then they ran away. The complainant fell from the machine. The bullet hit the complainant on elbow of right hand. Somehow the complainant managed to reach the village and a person called a car and admitted the complainant in District Hospital.

3.1 That on 04.03.2013, the duty doctor in the District Hospital informed the police and on the basis of the statement of the complainant, a Dehati Nalishi bearing No. 0/13 was registered under Sections 307 and 34 of the IPC.

3.2 That the medical examination of the injured complainant was conducted at District Hospital and five injuries were found on his body and injuries nos. 1 to 4 were opined to be caused by fire arm and injury no.5 was advised for x-ray.

3.3 That on 05.03.2013, the police reached on the spot and prepared spot map; statement of witnesses were recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. and the police seized simple soil, blood stained soil and other articles from the spot of the incident and prepared their seizure memos.",Civil Case
"5. In B.S. Joshi1 , the undisputed facts were these : the husband was one of the appellants while the wife was respondent no. 2 in the appeal before this Court. They were married on 21.7.1999 and were living separately since 15.7.2000. An FIR was registered under Sections 498-A/323 and 406, IPC at the instance of the wife on 2.1.2002. When the criminal case registered at the instance of the wife was pending, the dispute between the husband and wife and their family members was settled. It appears that the wife filed an affidavit that her disputes with the husband and the other members of his family had been finally settled and she and her husband had agreed for mutual divorce. Based on the said affidavit, the matter was taken to the High Court by both the parties and they jointly prayed for quashing the criminal proceedings launched against the husband and his family members on the basis of the FIR registered at the wife’s instance under Sections 498-A and 406 IPC. The High Court dismissed the petition for quashing the FIR as in its view the offences under Sections 498-A and 406, IPC were non-compoundable and the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code could not be invoked to by-pass Section 320 of the Code. It is from this order that the matter reached this Court. This Court held that the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers could quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section 320 of the Code did not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code. The Court in paragraphs 14 and 15 (Pg. 682) of the Report held as under :

“14. There is no doubt that the object of introducing Chapter XX- A containing Section 498-A in the Indian Penal Code was to prevent torture to a woman by her husband or by relatives of her husband. Section 498-A was added with a view to punishing a husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hypertechnical view would be counterproductive and would act against interests of women and against the object for which this provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent women from settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XX-A of the Indian Penal Code.
15. In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section 320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code.”
6. In Nikhil Merchant2, a company, M/s. Neemuch Emballage Ltd., Mumbai was granted financial assistance by Andhra Bank under various facilities. On account of default in repayment of loans, the bank filed a suit for recovery of the amount payable by the borrower company. The bank also filed a complaint against the company, its Managing Director and the officials of Andhra Bank for diverse offences, namely, Section 120-B read with Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 of the IPC read with Sections 5(2) and 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The suit for recovery filed by the bank against the company and the Managing Director of the Company was compromised. The suit was compromised upon the defendants agreeing to pay the amounts due as per the schedule mentioned in the consent terms. Clause 11 of the consent terms read, “agreed that save as aforesaid neither party has any claim against the other and parties do hereby withdraw all the allegations and counter-allegations made against each other”. Based on clause 11 of the consent terms, the Managing Director of the Company, the appellant who was accused no. 3 in charge sheet filed by CBI, made application for discharge from the criminal complaint. The said application was rejected by the Special Judge (CBI), Greater Bombay, which came to be challenged before the Bombay High Court. The contention before the High Court was that since the subject matter of the dispute had been settled between the appellant and the bank, it would be unreasonable to continue with the criminal proceedings. The High Court rejected the application for discharge from the criminal cases. It is from this order that the matter reached this Court by way of special leave. The Court having regard to the facts of the case and the earlier decision of this Court in B.S. Joshi1, set aside the order of the High Court and quashed the criminal proceedings by consideration of the matter thus:

“28. The basic intention of the accused in this case appears to have been to misrepresent the financial status of the Company, M/s Neemuch Emballage Ltd., Mumbai, in order to avail of the credit facilities to an extent to which the Company was not entitled. In other words, the main intention of the Company and its officers was to cheat the Bank and induce it to part with additional amounts of credit to which the Company was not otherwise entitled.
29. Despite the ingredients and the factual content of an offence of cheating punishable under Section 420 IPC, the same has been made compoundable under sub-section (2) of Section 320 CrPC with the leave of the court. Of course, forgery has not been included as one of the compoundable offences, but it is in such cases that the principle enunciated in B.S. Joshi case becomes relevant.
30. In the instant case, the disputes between the Company and the Bank have been set at rest on the basis of the compromise arrived at by them whereunder the dues of the Bank have been cleared and the Bank does not appear to have any further claim against the Company. What, however, remains is the fact that certain documents were alleged to have been created by the appellant herein in order to avail of credit facilities beyond the limit to which the Company was entitled. The dispute involved herein has overtones of a civil dispute with certain criminal facets. The question which is required to be answered in this case is whether the power which independently lies with this Court to quash the criminal proceedings pursuant to the compromise arrived at, should at all be exercised?
31. On an overall view of the facts as indicated hereinabove and keeping in mind the decision of this Court in B.S. Joshi case and the compromise arrived at between the Company and the Bank as also Clause 11 of the consent terms filed in the suit filed by the Bank, we are satisfied that this is a fit case where technicality should not be allowed to stand in the way in the quashing of the criminal proceedings, since, in our view, the continuance of the same after the compromise arrived at between the parties would be a futile exercise.”",Criminal Case
"5. On 19.2.2004, Ministry of Finance & Central Board of Customs & Excise cancelled an inter-Commissionerate transfers allowed in Groups B, C and D employees and introduced transferability on compassionate grounds on deputation only.

8. Aggrieved by absence of on all India liability, a representation preferred by the applicants when not responded to by the respondents led to filing of OA-540/2007, which was disposed of by treating the OA as representation and disposal thereof on 30.3.2007. Non-compliance resulted in a contempt petition, being CP-292/2007, where certain directions have been issued. Vide an order passed on 19.10.2007, respondents rejected the claim of the applicants on the ground that as per the existing policy of the CBEC, inter-Commissionerate transfers have been discontinued as transfers allowed under the previous policy resulted in enormous litigation. However, on extreme compassionate grounds, such transfers could be allowed on deputation basis initially for a period of three years and upto a maximum of five years.",Administrative Case
"57. On the basis of the reasoning and discussion above, the following conclusions arise:

(1) That when an empowered officer or a duly authorised officer acting on prior information is about to search a person, it is imperative for him to inform the concerned person of his right under Sub-section (1) of Section 50 of being taken to the nearest Gazetted Officer or the nearest Magistrate for making the search. However, such information may not necessarily be in writing;
(2) That failure to inform the concerned person about the existence of his right to be searched before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate would cause prejudice to an accused;
(3) That a search made, by an empowered officer, on prior information, without informing the person of his right that, if he so requires, he shall be taken before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate for search and in case he so opts, failure to conduct his search before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, may not vitiate the trial but would render the recovery of the illicit article suspect and vitiate the conviction and sentence of an accused, where the conviction has been recorded only on the basis of the possession of the illicit article, recovered from his person, during a search conducted in violation of the provisions of Section 50 of the Act;
(4) That there is indeed need to protect society from criminals. The societal intent in safety will suffer if persons who commit crimes are let off because the evidence against them is to be treated as if it does not exist. The answer, therefore, is that the investigating agency must follow the procedure as envisaged by the statute scrupulously and the failure to do so must be viewed by the higher authorities seriously inviting action against the concerned official so that the laxity on the part of the investigating authority is curbed. In every case the end result is important but the means to achieve it must remain above board. The remedy cannot be worse than the disease itself. The legitimacy of judicial process may come under cloud if the court is seen to condone acts of lawlessness conducted by the investigating agency during search operations and may also undermine respect for law and may have the effect of unconscionably compromising the administration of justice. That cannot be permitted. An accused is entitled to a fair trial. A conviction resulting from an unfair trial is contrary to our concept of justice. The use of evidence collected in breach of the safeguards provided by Section 50 at the trial, would render the trial unfair.
(5) That whether or not the safeguards provided in Section 50 have been duly observed would have to be determined by the Court on the basis of evidence led at the trial. Finding on that issue, one way or the other, would be relevant for recording an order of conviction or acquittal. Without giving an opportunity to the prosecution to establish, at the trial, that the provisions of Section 50, and particularly the safeguards provided therein were duly complied with, it would not be permissible to cut-short a criminal trial;
(6) That in the context in which the protection has been incorporated in Section 50 for the benefit of the person intended to be searched, we do not express any opinion whether the provisions of Section 50 are mandatory or directory, but, hold that failure to inform the concerned person of his right as emanating from Sub-section (1) of Section 50, may render the recovery of the contraband suspect and the conviction and sentence of an accused bad and unsustainable in law;
(7) That an illicit article seized from the person of an accused during search conducted in violation of the safeguards provided in Section 50 of the Act cannot be used as evidence of proof of unlawful possession of the contraband on the accused though any other material recovered during that search may be relied upon by the prosecution, in other proceedings, against an accused, notwithstanding the recovery of that material during an illegal search;
(8) A presumption under Section 54 of the Act can only be raised after the prosecution has established that the accused was found to be in possession of the contraband in a search conducted in accordance with the mandate of Section 50. An illegal search cannot entitle the prosecution to raise a presumption under Section 54 of the Act (9) That the judgment in Pooran Mal's case cannot be understood to have laid down that an illicit article seized  during a search of a person, on prior information, conducted in violation of the provisions of Section 50 of the Act, can by itself be used as evidence of unlawful possession of the illicit article on the person from whom the contraband has been seized during the illegal search;
(10) That the judgment in Ali Mustaffa's case correctly interprets and distinguishes the judgment in Pooran Mal's case and the broad observations made in Pirthi Chand's case and Jasbir Singh's case are not in tune with the correct exposition of law as laid down in Pooran Mal's case. The above conclusions are not a summary of our judgment and have to be read and considered in the light of the entire discussion contained in the earlier part.”
49. Immediately after this judgment, Parliament enacted sub-sections (5) and (6). Despite the enactment of these provisions, this Court in Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja (supra) specifically held as follows:
“24. Although the Constitution Bench in Baldev Singh case [(1999) 6 SCC 172] did not decide in absolute terms the question whether or not Section 50 of the NDPS Act was directory or mandatory yet it was held that provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 50 make it imperative for the empowered officer to “inform” the person concerned (suspect) about the existence of his right that if he so requires, he shall be searched before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate; failure to “inform” the suspect about the existence of his said right would cause prejudice to him, and in case he so opts, failure to conduct his search before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate, may not vitiate the trial but would render the recovery of the illicit article suspect and vitiate the conviction and sentence of an accused, where the conviction has been recorded only on the basis of the possession of the illicit article, recovered from the person during a search conducted in violation of the provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act. The Court also noted that it was not necessary that the information required to be given under Section 50 should be in a prescribed form or in writing but it was mandatory that the suspect was made aware of the existence of his right to be searched before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate, if so required by him. We respectfully concur with these conclusions. Any other interpretation of the provision would make the valuable right conferred on the suspect illusory and a farce.
xxx xxx xxx
27. It can, thus, be seen that apart from the fact that in Karnail Singh [(2009) 8 SCC 539], the issue was regarding the scope and applicability of Section 42 of the NDPS Act in the matter of conducting search, seizure and arrest without warrant or authorisation, the said decision does not depart from the dictum laid down in Baldev Singh case [(1999) 6 SCC 172] insofar as the obligation of the empowered officer to inform the suspect of his right enshrined in sub-section (1) of Section 50 of the NDPS Act is concerned. It is also plain from the said paragraph that the flexibility in procedural requirements in terms of the two newly inserted sub-sections can be resorted to only in emergent and urgent situations, contemplated in the provision, and not as a matter of course. Additionally, sub-section (6) of Section 50 of the NDPS Act makes it imperative and obligatory on the authorised officer to send a copy of the reasons recorded by him for his belief in terms of sub-section (5), to his immediate superior officer, within the stipulated time, which exercise would again be subjected to judicial scrutiny during the course of trial.",Constitutional Case
"9. Despite the fact that the controversy has been fully settled by a judgment of this Court, it has been raised from time to time in a number of writ petitions before the various High Courts. We would reproduce some of the judgments to demonstrate that after the controversy has been finally settled by this Court, the filing of indiscriminate petitions with the same relief creates unnecessary strain on the judicial system and consequently leads to inordinate delay in disposal of genuine and bona fide cases.

19. The aforementioned cases clearly give us the picture how the judicial process has been abused from time to time and after the controversy was finally settled by a Constitution Bench of this Court, repeatedly the petitions were filed in the various courts.",Constitutional Case
"9.2 In present case, the search warrant was executed on 5th Dec., 1995. At that time certain books and cash were seized. Certain jewellery and books, etc. found were not seized but in respect of which a PO was passed. A valid panchanama was prepared at that time for which there is no dispute. Subsequently, the assessee was called in a summons issued under Section 131 on various dates for giving evidence, which assessee could not attend due to his ill-health and as advised by doctor to take rest. This fact is apparent from reply of assessee to show cause notice issued before levying penalty under Section 272A(1)(c) of the Act. The same authorised officer thereafter revoked the PO concluded the search for which a valid panchanama was prepared on 24th Jan., 1996. The assessee was served with a notice under Section 158BC(c) dt. 8th Feb., 1996, to file return for block period. The assessee filed the return on 1st March, 1996, disclosing total income of Rs. 37,31,050. The learned counsel for assessee based on above facts argued that items under PO were certain jewellery being less than 500 gms and certain F.D. receipts and pass books only. Since jewellery found was less than 500 gms. the authorised officer could not have seized the same a per CBDT instruction. The pass book and other fixed deposits were so small in volume that same could have been seized on first instance on 5th Dec., 1995, only and hence there was no need to put the same under PO. The learned authorised representative thereafter relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of B.K. Nowlakha v. Union of India (supra) wherein the Court held that Section 132(3) could be resorted to only if there was any practical difficulty in seizing the item which was liable to be seized. The Delhi High Court furthermore stated in that connection that if there were no practical difficulties then the authorised officer has the jurisdiction and duty to seize the books of account, other documents, money, bullion, valuable articles, etc. found as a result of the search if no explanation was coming forward in respect thereof. The Delhi High Court further commented in that case that the power under Section 132(3) cannot be so exercised as to circumvent the provision of Section 132(1) r/w Section 132 (5). It was, therefore, argued before us that ignoring the order under Section 132(3), the search was concluded on 5th Dec., 1995, only and hence order under Section 158BC(c) should have been passed on or before 31st Dec., 1996. Since the order under Section 158BC(c) in present case is passed on 28th Jan., 1997, same is not within time prescribed under Section 158BE and hence invalid.

9.3 The learned Departmental Representative Mr. Radhakrishna submitted that in the past the assessee has never filed any return under Section 139 of the Act. Thus, entire material found should be treated as relating to undisclosed income only. At first instance, the search which commenced on 5th Dec., 1995 at 8.15 a.m. in the morning was temporarily concluded at 7.00 p.m. At that time explanation of assessee was required on various material found. The authorised officer therefore, issued a PO and asked the assessee to appear on 8th Dec., 1995. As requested by assessee, the hearing was adjourned to 12th Dec., 1995 on which date also, assessee did not appear. Ultimately, as per convenience of both, the authorised officer and assessee, search was concluded on 24th Jan., 1996. There is a valid panchanama for conclusion of search on 24th Jan., 1996. Thus, the time-limit to pass an order under Section 158BC shall be 31st Jan., 1997, as per Section 158BE r/w Expln, 2 thereto. Thus, the order is within time-limit.

"1. The present Special Leave Petition has been preferred against the impugned judgment/final order dated 8.10.2013 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No.27343/2013.

The High Court, thus, refused to accept the compromise entered into between the parties, the effect whereof would be that the petitioners would face trial in the said FIR.

4. It may be stated at the outset that the petitioners herein, who are three in number, have been charged under various provisions of the IPC including for committing offence punishable under Section 307, IPC i.e. attempt to commit murder. FIR No.121/14.7.2010 was registered. In the aforesaid FIR, the allegations against the petitioners are that on 9.7.2010 at 7.00 A.M. while respondent No.2 was going on his motorcycle to bring diesel from village Lapoke, Jasbir Singh, Narinder Singh both sons of Baldev Singh and Baldev Singh son of Lakha Singh attacked him and injured him. Respondent No.2 was admitted in Shri Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Amritsar. After examination the doctor found four injuries on his person. Injury No.1 to 3 are with sharp edged weapons and injury No.4 is simple. From the statement of injured and MLR’s report, an FIR under sections 323/324/34 IPC was registered. After X-ray report relating to injury No.3, section 307 IPC was added in the FIR

6. During the pendency of trial proceedings, the matter has been compromised between the petitioners as well as the private respondent with the intervention of the Panchayat on 12.07.2013. It is clear from the above that three years after the incident, the parties compromised the matter with intervention of the Panchayat of the village.",Criminal Case
"2. The background facts are that after hearing the learned counsel for the parties at length, the Central Administrative Tribunal, Allahabad Bench passed a detailed order dismissing the Civil Contempt Petition No.164/2007 on 21.10.2011 which is extracted herein-below:-

Mr. M.K. Dhrubvansi, Advocate appared for the applicant and Sri S. Srivastava, Advocate for the respondents.
2. The present contempt petition has been filed under Section 17 of the CAT Act read with Rule 5 of the CAT Contempt of Court Act, 1987 for not compliance of the order dated 21st March, 2001 passed in O.A. No.1111 of 2000.
3. Counsel for the applicants submitted that the direction contained in para 4 of the order passed by this Tribunal has not been complied with by the respondents. On the other hand, Sri S. Srivastava, Counsel for the respondents argued that in compliance of the order passed by this Tribunal respondents have filed detailed Affidavit on 24.04.2008 along with the letter dated 23.04.2008 (Annexure -1) whereby the applicant has been granted all benefits as permissible under the law. He further submitted that in terms of direction passed by this Tribunal, they are regularly paying the bonus to the applicant as per their entitlement.
4. Counsel for the applicant drew our attention to the letter dated 27.01.2009 and 27.12.2008 stating that the bonus was paid to Casual labour (Applicants) Rs. 12000 per year whereas regular employee has been paid Rs. 4276/-, therefore, the respondents have not complied with the direction. He further submitted that respondents himself have issued the letter dated 8.12.1992 in which it is clearly mentioned that casual labours shall be treated at par with temporary Group D employees and would be entitled to such benefits as are admissible to Group D employees on regular basis.
5. We have gone through the order passed by this Tribunal dated 21st March, 2001, which reads as under:-
4. As the Honble Supreme Court held that after rendering three years continuous service with temporary status casual labourers shall be treated at par with temporary Group D employees in the Department of Posts and thereby entitled for such benefits as ar admissible to Group D employees on regular basis. The G.O. issued on 26.9.2000 cannot be justified. In our opinion the impugned order dated 19.9.2000 is illegal and viod which directs payment of bonus at the lesser rate and direction for recovery is illegal and cannot be sustained. The O.A. is accordingly allowed . The order dated 19.9.2000 is quashed. The respondents are directed to continue to pay the bonus to the applicant at the rate specified in the order dated 8.12.1992, which was passed on the basis of the judgment of the Honble Supreme Court. There shall be no order as to costs. By the above order the respondents are directed to continue to pay the bonus to the applicant at the rate specified in the order dated 08.12.1992 which was passed on the basis of Honble Supreme Court.
6. The contention raised by counsel for the applicant that they are not paid the same amount of bonus which has been given to the regular Group D employees is not acceptable as this Tribunal directed the respondents to pay the bonus at the rate specified. It does not mean that the applicants become entitle for the same amount of bonus in term of money which is payable to regular employee. The intention of the order is clear that they are entitled for bonus as per the prescribed formula as admissible to regular employee, which amo0ng other factor also takes into account the average emoluments drawn by an employee. This contention has also been clarified by the respondents vide letter dated 25.09.2006.
7. In view of the above, we find that the order passed by this Tribunal has fully been complied with. Therefore, the instant Contempt Petition is dismissed. Notices issued to the respondents are discharged.",Administrative Case
"2.1 It is this preliminary ground alone which as also submitted by both sides is proposed to be disposed of by this order first as it would determine the Tribunal's jurisdiction to call for the records relating to the reasons authorising the search on which shall depend the manner in which the hearing of the appeal on the remaining grounds shall proceed.

7. Shri Garg contended that both on factual basis and in law the assessee was fully entitled to know the reasons which actuated the competent authority to form ""reason to believe"" for authorising the search. In this connection he placed reliance on a decision of the jurisdictional High Court in the case of K. M. Bansal v. CIT [1992] 195 ITR 247/[1991] 59 Taxman 463 (All.) and submitted that although this decision related to the provisions of section 148 of the Act, yet its analogy applied on all fours to the facts of the present case. As per this decision, to eliminate the possibility of an arbitrary action, an officer who is required to record reasons was equally bound to give reasons, which inter alia could be looked into by a superior authority to satisfy himself that action had not been initiated arbitrarily. It was, however, open to him to withhold the name of informants and/or identify of sources if it was thought necessary to protect the sources and informants as per which after the assessee had participated in the proceedings if asked for, the reasons for forming the belief should be disclosed to him. Shri Garg also submitted that despite having taken objection from the beginning about the non-existence of the 'reason to believe' with the competent officer authorising search and furnishing of the 'satisfaction note' recorded by him, the Assessing Officer developed a cold feet, maintained a stoic silence and even did not consider it necessary to devote any time to deal with this aspect of the matter having far reaching consequences.",Administrative Case
"3. The Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 (the Act) was enacted with a view ""to consolidate and amend the law relating to Central Duties of Excise and Salt"". The Statement of Objects and Reasons [vide Gazette of India, 1943, Part-V, P. 243) stated inter alia:

The administration of internal commodity taxation in British India has grown up piecemeal over many years and has been considerably expanded during the last decade. Hitherto the introduction of a new central duty of excise has required the enactment of self-contained law and the preparation of a separate set of statutory rules. There are no less than 10 separate excise Acts...and 11 sets of statutory rules; and there are also 5 Acts relating to salt....This agglomeration of statutes and regulations dealing with similar matters is neither convenient for the public nor conducive to well-organized administrations...
(2) It is accordingly proposed to consolidate in a single enactment all the laws relating to central duties of excise and to the tax on salt and to embody therein a Schedule, similar to that in the Indian Tariff Act, 1934, setting forth the rates of duty leviable on each class of goods. At the same time, the statutory rule will be similarly amalgamated and disembarrassed of their unnecessary details. The Act and the consolidated statutory rules, together with as many manuals of departmental instructions as may be necessary, will then form a complete Central Excise Code, which will simplify the administration of this branch of the revenue system and aid such further development as may be necessary...
37. The facts of the decision in Tilokchand Motichand and Ors. v. H.B. Munshi and Anr. are rather interesting. They tell us how the Court viewed the attempt of a person who tried to take advantage of the decision in another person's case rendered several years later. The authorities under the Bombay Sales Tax Act refunded certain amounts to the petitioners-dealers on the condition that they should pass on the said amounts to their customers (these amounts were earlier collected by the dealers from their customers and paid to the State). On the ground that the dealers have failed to pass on the said amounts to their customers, the authorities forfeited the said amounts under Section 21(4) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953. The dealers filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the constitutional validity of Section 21(4). A learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition holding that inasmuch as the petitioners-dealers have defrauded their customers, they were not entitled to any relief under Article 226. The appeal preferred by the dealers was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court holding that even if there was a violation of petitioners' fundamental right, the High Court was not bound to come to their help in view of their conduct. The dealers accordingly paid up the said amount in instalments between August, 1959 and August, 1960. More than seven years later, i.e., on September 29, 1967, this Court struck down Section 12(A)(iv) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1946 corresponding to Section 21(4) of the 1953 Act in Kantilal Babulal v. H.C. Patel, 21 S.T.C. 174. On February 9, 1968, the petitioners filed a writ petition in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution for refund of the aforesaid amounts on the assumption that Section 21(4) is unconstitutional in view of the decision of this Court in Kantilal Babulal. They submitted that though they had raised other grounds in support of their attack upon the validity of Section 21(4) in the High Court, they were not aware of the particular ground upon which the corresponding provision in the 1946 Act was struck down by this Court in Kantilal Babulal, This Court, by majority (Hidayatullah, CJ., Bachawat and Mitter, JJ.) dismissed the writ petition holding that the judgment of the High Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the writ petitioner operates as res judicata and bars the petition under Article 32. Hidayatullah, C.J. made the following relevant observations:

The petitioner moved the High Court for the relief on the ground that the recovery from him was unconstitutional. He set out a number of grounds but did not set out the ground on which ultimately in another case recovery was struck down by this Court. That ground was that the provisions of the Act were unconstitutional. The question is: can the petitioner in this case take advantage, after a lapse of a number of years, of the decision of this Court? He moved the High Court but did not come up in appeal to this Court, His contention is that the ground on which his petition was dismissed was different and the ground on which the statute was struck down was not within his knowledge and therefore he did not know of it and pursue it in this Court. To that I answer that law will presume that he knew the exact ground of unconstitutionality. Everybody is presumed to know the law. It was his duty to have brought the matter before this Court for consideration. In any event, having set the machinery of law in motion he cannot abandon it to resume it after a number of years, because another person more adventurous than he in his turn got the statute declared unconstitutional, and got a favourable decision. If I were to hold otherwise, then the decision of the High Court in any case once adjudicated upon and acquiesced in may be questioned in a fresh litigation revived only with the argument, that the correct position was not known to the petitioner at the time when he abandoned his own litigation. I agree with the opinion of my brethren Bachawat and Mitter, JJ. that there is no question here of a mistake of law entitling the petitioner to invoke analogy of the Article in the Limitation Act. The grounds on which he moved the Court might well have impressed this Court which might also have decided the question of the unconstitutionality of the Act as was done in the subsequent litigation by another party. The present petitioner should have taken the right ground in the High Court and taken it in appeal to this Court after the High Court decided against it. Not having done so and having abandoned his own litigation years ago, I do not think that this Court should apply the analogy of the Article in the Limitation Act and give him the relief now.
(Emphasis added)
40. The appeals were, however, dismissed holding that since the appellant has failed to claim the relief of refund in the first writ petition filed by him, he is disentitled from doing so by way of a separate subsequent writ petition. It was observed that it is not open to the appellant to split up his claim for refund and file writ petitions in a piece-meal fashion. The decision is significant for pointing out the irrational and unjust consequences of the holding in Bhailal Bhai and Aluminium Industries which implicitly followed Kanhaiyalal. The decision is also significant for pointing out the adverse impact of public interest inherent in holding (See Kanhaiyalal again) that the plea that the State has expended the taxes on public purposes is no defence to a claim for refund.

2. Stated briefly, the controversy centers round the tenability or otherwise of the claim for refund of the amounts paid be way of excise duty under the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, now titled as Central Excise Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Excise Act') on the ground that it was so done under ""mistake of law"". It will be convenient to deal with the controversy by adverting to the minimal facts in the main appeal argued before us - Civil Appeal No. 3255 of 1984 - Mafatlal Industries Ltd., Ahmedabad v. Union of India. The appellant is a textile mill situate at Ahmedabad. The appellant and a few other mills manufacture ""blended yarn"". The said blended yearn was captively consumed by the various mills for manufacture of fabric, popularly known as ""art silk"" fabric. For the period prior to March 16/17, 1972, the mills paid excise duty on blended yarn manufactured for captive consumption under Tariff Item 18 or 18A of the First Schedule to the Excise Act. In Special Application No. 1058/72 filed by M/s. Calico Mills, who manufactured fabrics and was captively consuming blended yarn, produced by it for manufacturing fabric known as ""art silk fabric"", a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court by judgment dated 15.1.1976, held that the levy of the excise duty on blended yarn prior to March 16/17, 1972, under tariff Item 18 or 18A was clearly ultra vires. The High Court directed refund of the excise duty levied for 3 years prior to institution of the petition, which was instituted on 6.5.1972. The appellant and other mill-owners stated that as a result of the declaration of the law as aforesaid by the Court, they were not liable to pay excise duty on blended yarn up to March 16/17, 1972 and that they had paid the excise duty on the same upto that date under mistake of law. They requested for refund of the excise duty so paid till March 16/17, 1972, stating that such duty was illegally recovered from them. The Revenue did not refund the excise duty as claimed. So, the appellant and others filed suits within three years of the aforesaid judgment (15.1.1976) for refund of excise duty illegally recovered from them, with interest. The trial court decreed the suits. In the appeals filed by the Union of India against the aforesaid decrees passed by the trial court, the High Court of Gujarat allowed the appeals and set aside the decrees passed by the trial courts, by judgment dated 6.4.1984. It was held that in order to successfully sustain the claim of restitution based on Section 72 of the Contract Act, the person claiming restitution should prove ""loss or injury"" to him, and in the cases before them, the excise duty paid on blended yarn was ultimately passed on to the buyer of the fabric, and so the claim for restitution will not lie. In other words, in cases where an assessee has ""passed on"" the duty paid by or realised from him, he has suffered no loss or injury, and the action for restitution is unsustainable. The aforesaid statement of the law is seriously disputed by the appellants in Civil Appeal No. 3255/84 and others.

13. The main case relied on, Kanhaiya Lal's case (supra) requires a little detailed examination. The respondent, Kanhaiya Lal was a firm. For the assessment years 1948-49, 1949-50 and 1950-51, its forward transactions were brought to tax by the Assessing Authority - the Sales Tax Officer, as per Assessment orders dated 31.5.1949, 30.10.1950 and 22.8.1951. On 27.2.1952, the Allahabad High Court in Messrs Budh Prakash Jai Prakash v. Sales Tax Officer, Kanpur and Ors. (1952) A.L.J. 332 held that the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, taxing forward contracts were ultra vires the U.P. Legislature. The said judgment was affirmed by this Court or 3.5.1954. The attempts of the assessee to obtain refund of tax basing its claim on Budh Prakash Jai Prakash ease before the statutory authorities were futile. Thereafter, the assessee-firm filed a writ petition in the High Court, praying to quash the assessment orders, and for direction for refund of tax illegally collected. By judgment dated 30.11.1956, a learned single Judge of the High Court, allowed the writ petition. In the appeal, the Revenue contended that since the tax was paid under mistake of law, it was not recoverable. Even so, relying on Section 72 of the Contract Act, the Division Bench affirmed the decision of the single Judge. The Revenue took up the matter in appeal before this Court. The pleas of the appellant-Revenue, that the assessee should have followed the procedure prescribed by the U.P. Sales Tax Act and, that the writ petition filed for refund of money would not lie, were not allowed to be urged by this Court. Mainly, two questions arose before this Court for consideration -",Constitutional Case
"5. In B.S. Joshi1 , the undisputed facts were these : the husband was one of the appellants while the wife was respondent no. 2 in the appeal before this Court. They were married on 21.7.1999 and were living separately since 15.7.2000. An FIR was registered under Sections 498-A/323 and 406, IPC at the instance of the wife on 2.1.2002. When the criminal case registered at the instance of the wife was pending, the dispute between the husband and wife and their family members was settled. It appears that the wife filed an affidavit that her disputes with the husband and the other members of his family had been finally settled and she and her husband had agreed for mutual divorce. Based on the said affidavit, the matter was taken to the High Court by both the parties and they jointly prayed for quashing the criminal proceedings launched against the husband and his family members on the basis of the FIR registered at the wife’s instance under Sections 498-A and 406 IPC. The High Court dismissed the petition for quashing the FIR as in its view the offences under Sections 498-A and 406, IPC were non-compoundable and the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code could not be invoked to by-pass Section 320 of the Code. It is from this order that the matter reached this Court. This Court held that the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers could quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section 320 of the Code did not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code. The Court in paragraphs 14 and 15 (Pg. 682) of the Report held as under :

“14. There is no doubt that the object of introducing Chapter XX- A containing Section 498-A in the Indian Penal Code was to prevent torture to a woman by her husband or by relatives of her husband. Section 498-A was added with a view to punishing a husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hypertechnical view would be counterproductive and would act against interests of women and against the object for which this provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent women from settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XX-A of the Indian Penal Code.
15. In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section 320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code.”
6. In Nikhil Merchant2, a company, M/s. Neemuch Emballage Ltd., Mumbai was granted financial assistance by Andhra Bank under various facilities. On account of default in repayment of loans, the bank filed a suit for recovery of the amount payable by the borrower company. The bank also filed a complaint against the company, its Managing Director and the officials of Andhra Bank for diverse offences, namely, Section 120-B read with Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 of the IPC read with Sections 5(2) and 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The suit for recovery filed by the bank against the company and the Managing Director of the Company was compromised. The suit was compromised upon the defendants agreeing to pay the amounts due as per the schedule mentioned in the consent terms. Clause 11 of the consent terms read, “agreed that save as aforesaid neither party has any claim against the other and parties do hereby withdraw all the allegations and counter-allegations made against each other”. Based on clause 11 of the consent terms, the Managing Director of the Company, the appellant who was accused no. 3 in charge sheet filed by CBI, made application for discharge from the criminal complaint. The said application was rejected by the Special Judge (CBI), Greater Bombay, which came to be challenged before the Bombay High Court. The contention before the High Court was that since the subject matter of the dispute had been settled between the appellant and the bank, it would be unreasonable to continue with the criminal proceedings. The High Court rejected the application for discharge from the criminal cases. It is from this order that the matter reached this Court by way of special leave. The Court having regard to the facts of the case and the earlier decision of this Court in B.S. Joshi1, set aside the order of the High Court and quashed the criminal proceedings by consideration of the matter thus:

“28. The basic intention of the accused in this case appears to have been to misrepresent the financial status of the Company, M/s Neemuch Emballage Ltd., Mumbai, in order to avail of the credit facilities to an extent to which the Company was not entitled. In other words, the main intention of the Company and its officers was to cheat the Bank and induce it to part with additional amounts of credit to which the Company was not otherwise entitled.
29. Despite the ingredients and the factual content of an offence of cheating punishable under Section 420 IPC, the same has been made compoundable under sub-section (2) of Section 320 CrPC with the leave of the court. Of course, forgery has not been included as one of the compoundable offences, but it is in such cases that the principle enunciated in B.S. Joshi case becomes relevant.
30. In the instant case, the disputes between the Company and the Bank have been set at rest on the basis of the compromise arrived at by them whereunder the dues of the Bank have been cleared and the Bank does not appear to have any further claim against the Company. What, however, remains is the fact that certain documents were alleged to have been created by the appellant herein in order to avail of credit facilities beyond the limit to which the Company was entitled. The dispute involved herein has overtones of a civil dispute with certain criminal facets. The question which is required to be answered in this case is whether the power which independently lies with this Court to quash the criminal proceedings pursuant to the compromise arrived at, should at all be exercised?
31. On an overall view of the facts as indicated hereinabove and keeping in mind the decision of this Court in B.S. Joshi case and the compromise arrived at between the Company and the Bank as also Clause 11 of the consent terms filed in the suit filed by the Bank, we are satisfied that this is a fit case where technicality should not be allowed to stand in the way in the quashing of the criminal proceedings, since, in our view, the continuance of the same after the compromise arrived at between the parties would be a futile exercise.”",Civil Case
"9. An OM was issued by the Department of Personnel & Training (DoP&T) granting a higher pay scale of Rs.3000-4500 to those PSs, who had rendered 8 years regular service in the grade of Rs.2000-3500 and who were attached with the Secretary level officers. Accordingly, PSs, who were attached with Honble Chairman/Vice-Chairmen in the CAT, made representations to the Government for granting the same pay scale to them as well on the principle of equal pay for equal work. However, their representations were rejected without any proper justification. Being aggrieved, Shri S.K. Sareen, one of the PSs, who was at the relevant time attached with the Honble Vice Chairman, filed OA No.777/1992, which was allowed by the Tribunal vide order dated 20.12.1999. Writ Petition (Civil) No.2500/2000 filed by the Union of India against the aforesaid decision was dismissed on 19.4.2002. Even the SLP No.1565/2003 filed by the Union of India was dismissed on 28.2.2003, affirming the decision of the Tribunal in S.K. Sareen (supra). In compliance of the aforesaid decision of the Tribunal, Government of India passed order dated 9.2.2005 (Annexure G), revising the pay scale from Rs.2000-3500 to Rs.3000-4500 (pre-revised) and one post of Principal Private Secretary (PPS) was upgraded to the pay scale of Rs.12000-16500 from Rs.10000-15200 as Senior Principal Private Secretary and 16 posts of PSs attached to the Honble Vice Chairmen in CAT to Principal Private Secretary from the scale of pay of Rs.6500-10500 to Rs.10000-15200 (pre-revised), thereby again bringing the PSs of the CAT at par with their counterparts in CSSS.

10. Vide order dated 25.1.2006 (Annexure H), the Government of India granted Non-Functional Selection Grade (NFSG) of Rs.8000-13500 to the PSs/SOs in the CSSS/CSS. Having denied the same benefit to the SOs/PSs in the CAT, some of the PSs working at Ernakulam Bench of the Tribunal filed OA No.475/2006, for grant of NFSG of Rs.8000-13500, claiming historical parity with the PSs of CSSS. The said OA was disposed of with a direction to the respondents to consider the claim of applicants, who are PSs in the Ernakulam Bench of the Tribunal, in the light of the averments made in the OA as well as the legal questions considered in the earlier judgments by the Tribunal and communicate a decision to the applicants. Non-compliance of the order led to filing of CP No.05/2007, which was, after hearing, disposed of on 6.11.2007, with a direction to the respondents to furnish the details of reference to the VI Central Pay Commission either by way of an affidavit by an officer at appropriate level or by filing the copies of the very reference, with copy to the counsel for the applicants, within a period of six weeks and the matter was converted into an execution application and directed to be listed on 2.1.2008. Thereafter, again in MA No.854/2008, a direction was issued on 28.2.2008 to the Secretary, DoP&T to personally handle the matter or at least monitor the matter and try to persuade the VI Central Pay Commission to consider the case of the applicants and other similarly situated. The Principal Registrar, CAT (respondent No.3 herein), was also directed to make available all the relevant materials to the Secretary and have due interaction with the DoP&T. Although in spite of aforesaid directions no reference was made to the Sixth Pay Commission, but, on 21.4.2008, learned senior standing counsel appearing for DoP&T & Ministry of Finance filed compliance affidavit, stating as follows:

I am the Senior Central Government Standing Counsel appearing for the respondents in the above Original Application. This statement is filed on the basis of the instructions furnished by the respondents.
2. The above Miscellaneous Application had been filed by the petitioner/Applicant alleging disobedience of the directions contained in the Annexure P-1 Order of this Honourable Tribunal in Original Application No.475 of 2006 and also such other reliefs.
3. In this connection it is pertinent to note that the Respondents had fully complied with the directions of this Honourable Tribunal in the above Original Application contained in the Order dated 3.4.2007.
4. As per the directions of this Honourable Tribunal in the order dated 28.2.2008 the respondents have fully complied with the order. The Sixth Central Pay Commission has already submitted its report to the Government in which the Commission has examined and recommended the issue of parity of employees of Central Administrative Tribunal with employees of CSS & CSSS cadre in Paragraph 7.32.25 of its recommendations. A True copy of the relevant portion of the Recommendations of the 6th Pay Commission, is produced herewith and marked as ANNEXURE R-1.
5. It is pertinent to submit that pursuant to the Order of this Honourable Tribunal in this case was, the matter was forwarded for the implementation to the Department of Personnel and Training for taking up the matter will Pay Commission. Since the report has already been submitted by the 6th Central Pay Commission to the Government, the directions of this Honourable Tribunal had been complied with.
6. On a perusal of the above facts, it can be seen that the Respondent had fully complied with the directions of this Honourable Tribunal contained in the 3.4.2007 in Original Application NO.475 of 2006 in its letter and spirit and there is no wilful negligence or laches on the part of the Respondent in implementing the order of this Honourable Tribunal within the stipulated time. The Respondent tender unconditional apology for the delay if any, caused in implementing the order of this Honourable Tribunal. Hence the above Miscellaneous Application is liable to be dismissed and this Statement may also be accepted into file as full Compliance Report. It is pertinent to mention here that the aforesaid compliance affidavit was filed on the basis of the letter dated 27.3.2008 of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Personnel & Training, addressed to the Registrar, CAT, Principal Bench, which reads as follows:
I am directed to refer to your letter No.PB/4/21/06-R dated 20.3.2008 on the above subject and to say that 6th Central Pay Commission have already submitted its report/recommendations to the Government on 24.3.2008. As such, it may not be possible to make any further reference to Pay Commission.
2. However, the 6th Central Pay Commission have in para 3.1.9 and para 7.32.15 of its report (copy enclosed) relating to CAT have already recommended parity between Assistants/Section Officers/Stenographers of CSS/CSSS and similarly placed posts in field offices. In consonance with the aforesaid authority to the effect that VI CPC has recommended the issue of parity of employees of CAT with CSSS/CSS in para 3.1.9 and para 7.32.15 of the Report, Honble Tribunal at Ernakulam, on 26.06.2008 gave a direction to the respondents to work out and disburse pay scale and arrears to all the PSs of the CAT on refixation of their pay. Paras-2 & 3 of the aforesaid order dated 26.6.2008, read as follows:
2. Records would reveal that the Private Secretaries of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) had, under the Vth Pay Commission Recommendations been treated at par with their counterparts in the CSS/CSSS Cadre and accordingly the pay scale afforded to them has been made available to the Private Secretaries of CAT as well, with effect from 01.01.1996. Again, vide Annexure R-1 to the counter statement dated 21st April 2008, filed on 16th June 2008, the VI Pay Commission has also confirmed the parity between the two. This means that there is absolutely no question of different pay scales for the posts of Private Secretaries of CSS/CSSS on the one hand and the CAT on the other. As such, when for the Private Secretaries of CSS/CSSS the Government had introduced non-functional pay scale of Rs.8000-13000/-, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions attached thereto, the same non-functional pay scale is expected to be extended to the Private Secretaries of CAT from the very same date and subject to similar conditions. Otherwise, it would amount to derailment by the Government from the finding of the Pay Commission, which is not permissible. Perhaps, the reservation of the respondents earlier, in extending the non-functional pay scale of Rs.8000-13500/- to the Private Secretaries of C.A.T. was on account of the apprehension that the VI Pay Commission may or may not confirm the parity between the two sets of Private Secretaries. Now that in clear terms, parity has been confirmed by the VI Pay Commission, there should be no impediment for the respondents to pass suitable orders extending the pay scale of Rs.8000-13500/- from the date the Private Secretaries of the Central Secretariat Services/CSSS have been granted, subject no doubt to the fulfillment of the requisite conditions attached thereto.
3. It is a matter of record that such a situation in respect of Section Officers of the CBI has also been recently set right by the Principal Bench in OA No.377/06 by its order dated 1st May, 2007, which has been upheld by the Delhi High Court in Civil Writ Petition No.7475 of 2007 and CM No.14234 of 2007 vide order dated 10th October, 2007. In spite of the aforesaid directions of the Tribunal, Respondents have not passed any order granting the Non-Functional Selection Grade of Rs.8000-13500 to the applicants.
14. However, by way of an ad interim order, respondents have been directed to grant the Grade Pay of Rs.4800/- to the applicants initially and on completion of four years service in the grade to Rs.5400/-, which has been complied with by re-fixing the pay of applicants but the arrears have not been paid. The VI CPC in its recommendation in para 7.32.15 of its Report insofar as Assistants and Stenographers who demanded parity with their counterparts has stated that as the Commission has already recommended parity between the similarly placed posts of Secretariat and Field Offices, no separate recommendation was found necessary. However, while making recommendation in para 3.1.9 insofar as CSS pay scales are concerned, which were applied to the PSs and equivalent in the services, including SOs, the Pay Bands prescribed to these employees have been mutatis mutandis applied to the counterparts with the condition precedent that they should have a historical parity. In AFHQSS, this has been applied and it also includes the departments/organizations like MEA, CVC, UPSC, and inclusive of the CAT, for which no separate recommendations were made. The extracted portion of para 3.1.9 establishes the aforesaid.

15. While accepting the recommendations, Government of India, Ministry of Finance issued Notification dated 29.8.2008. Definition clause 3 (7) provides revised pay structure in relation to any post specified in column 2 of the First Schedule means the pay band and grade pay specified against that post or the pay scale specified in column 5 & 6 thereof, unless a different revised pay band and grade pay or pay scale is notified separately for that post. Accordingly, Section I of the Notification in Part-B concerns revised pay scales for certain common categories of staff. Section Officers/PS/equivalent under the heading Office Staff in the Secretariat have been allowed PB-2 with Grade Pay of Rs.4800/- and PB-3 with Grade Pay of Rs.5400/- as per para 3.1.9 of the report and those Organizations/Services, which have had a historical parity with CSS/CSSS, have also been accorded the same. However, in Part-II in case of the office staff working in Organizations outside the Secretariat, the recommendations contained in para 3.1.14 have been applied. Neither in the cadre of PS nor SO, the hierarchy shown exists in the CAT, which demonstrates non-applicability of the aforesaid recommendations in para 3.1.14 insofar as CAT and its employees are concerned, for which the recommendations, as referred to ibid would apply.",Administrative Case

The case of the petitioners was that the interview of each of them did not last for more than 2 or 3 minutes per candidate on an average and the only questions which were asked to them were formal questions relating to their parentage and residence and hardly any question was asked which would be relevant to any of the four factors for which marks were allocated at the viva voce examination. When the admissions were announced, the petitioners found that though they had obtained very good marks in the qualifying examination, they had not been able to secure admission to the college because the marks awarded to them at the viva voce examination were very low and candidates who had much less marks at the qualifying examination, had succeeded in obtaining very high marks at the viva voce examination and there by managed to secure admission in preference to the petitioners.

(v) On establishment of the Tribunal, the writ petition was transferred to it and was registered as Transferred Application No.826 of 1996. By an order dated 25.2.1997, the Tribunal dismissed the same. It held that the pay structure has been worked out by the Third Pay Commission after proper job evaluation of different services and posts; that there cannot be any equality among the members of different services; that the State Government was free to frame appropriate scheme for grant of higher pay scales to the members of some services who did not have adequate promotional opportunities and that in the absence of any evidence of parity, a mandatory direction cannot be issued for grant of higher pay scales to the applicants.

(x) After dismissal of the Special Leave Petition, the respondents filed R.A. No.26 of 1998 for review of order dated 25.2.1997 by asserting that they were stagnating in the same scale of pay since 1982 and the non-applicants arbitrarily denied them benefit of the higher scales which were given to the members of other services. The respondents pleaded that in view of the recommendations made by Secretary of Food and Supplies Department, which are binding on the State Government, they are entitled to Scale Nos.19 and 21.

"1960. March 25. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.-On December 10, 1958, Mr. M. L. Sethi lodged a First Information Report against the appellant Mr. R. P. Kapur and alleged that he and his mother-in-law Mrs. Kaushalya Devi had committed offences under ss. 420-109, 114 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. When the appellant found that for several months no further action was taken on the said First Information Report which was hanging like a sword over his head he filed a criminal complaint on April 1, 1959, against Mr. Sethi under ss. 204, 211 and 385 of the Indian Penal Code and thus took upon himself the onus to prove that -&he First Information Report lodged by Mr. Sethi was false. On the said complaint Mr. Sethi moved that the proceedings in question should be stayed as the police had not made any report on the First Information Report lodged by him and that the case started by him was still pending with the police. After hearing arguments the learned Magistrate ordered that the appellant's complaint should stand adjourned.

Thereupon the appellant moved the Punjab High Court under s. 561 -A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the proceedings initiated by the First Information Report in question. Pending the hearing of the said petition in the said High Court the police report was submitted under s. 173 of the Code on July 25, 1959. Subsequently, on September 10, 1959, Mr. Justice Capoor heard the appellant's petition and held that no case had been made out for quashing the proceedings under s.561-A. In the result the petition was dismissed. It is against this order that the appellant has come to this Court by special leave, The material facts leading to the proceedings against the appellant lie within a very narrow compass. It appears that in January 1957 the mother-in-law of the appellant and his wife entered into an agreement with the owners of certain lands in village Mohammadpur Munirka to purchase lands at Rs. 5 per sq. yd. Earnest money was accordingly paid to the vendors and it was agreed that the sale had to be completed by April 13, 1957; by consent this period was extended to June 13, 1957. Meanwhile, on March 8, 1957, notifications were issued by the Chief Commissioner under ss. 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, for acquiring considerable area of land which included the lands belonging to the vendors; this acquisition was intended for the housing scheme of the Ministry of Works, Housing and Supply in the Government of India. The proposed acquisition was treated as one of urgency and so under s. 17 of the Acquisition Act possession of the land was taken by the Collector on June 8, 1957. Some of the persons concerned in the said lands filed objections against the validity of the action taken under s.

17. It was under these circumstances that the sale deeds were executed by the vendors in favour of Mrs. Kaushalya Devi and certain other vendees on June 12, 1957. It appears that the vendees presented their claim before the Land Acquisition Collector and an award has been made in Septem- ber 1958 by which Mrs. Kaushalya Devi has been allowed compensation at Rs. 3-8-0 per sq. yd. That is how the title of the lands in question passed to Mrs. Kaushalya Devi. The First Information Report filed by Mr. Sethi alleges that he and the appellant were friends and that on January 4,1958, the appellant dishonestly and fraudulently advised him-to purchase 2,000 sq. yds. of land in Khasra Nos. 22, 23, 24 and 25 in the aforesaid village Mohammadpur Munirka on the representation that as owner of the land in the area Mr. Sethi would get a plot of desired dimensions in the same area developed by the Ministry under its housing scheme. The appellant also represented to Mr. Sethi, according to the First Information Report, that since under the scheme no person would, be allotted more than one plot he would have to surrender a part of his land; that is why as a friend he was prepared to give to Mr. Sethi one plot at the price at which it had been purchased. According to Mr. Sethi the appellant dictated an application which he was advised to send to the Secretary of the Ministry of Works and he accordingly sent it as advised. The First Information Report further alleges that the appellant had assured Mr. Sethi that the land had been purchased by his mother-in-law at Rs. 10 per sq. yd. Acting on this representation Mr. Sethi paid Rs. 10,000 by cheque drawn in favour of Mrs. Kaushalya Devi on January 6, 1958. This cheque has been cashed. Subsequently a draft of the sale deed was sent by the appellant to Mr. Sethi in the beginning of March 1958 and on March 6, 1958, a further sum of Rs. 10,000 was paid by cheque. The draft was duly returned to the appellant with a covering letter in which Mr. Sethi stated that he would have liked to add one clause to the deed to the effect that in the event of the authorities not accepting the sale for the purpose of allotment, the amount of Rs. 20,000 would be refunded to him; and he expressed, the hope that even if the said clause was not included in the document the appellant would accept it. The sale deed in favour of Mr. Sethi was registered on March 21, 1958. It is this transaction which has given rise to the First Information Report in question.",Criminal Case

"2. The appellant (Indian Oil Corporation, for short 'IOC') entered into two contracts, one with the first respondent (NEPC India Ltd.) and the other with its sister company Skyline NEPC Limited ('Skyline' for short) agreeing to supply to them aviation turbine fuel and aviation lubricants (together referred to as ""aircraft fuel""). According to the appellant, in respect of the aircraft fuel supplied under the said contracts, the first respondent became due in a sum of Rs.5,28,23,501.90 and Skyline became due in a sum of Rs.13,12,76,421.25 as on 29.4.1997.

4. As NEPC India failed to pay the first two instalments as per schedule, IOC stopped supply of aircraft fuel on 3.6.1997. However, subsequently, under a fresh agreement dated 20.9.1997, a revised payment schedule was agreed and IOC agreed to re-commence supply of aircraft fuel on 'cash and carry' basis.

"2. The first writ petition is that filed by Iqbal Chagla and others in the High Court of Bombay. The petitioners in this writ petition are advocates practising in the High Court of Bombay and they have challenged a circular letter dated March 18, 1981, addressed by Shri Shiv Shankar, the Law Minister of the Government of India, to the Governor of Punjab and the Chief Ministers of the other States. Since the circular letter has formed the subject-matter of heated controversy between the parties and its constitutional validity has been assailed on behalf of the petitioners, it would be desirable to reproduce it in extenso in the words of the author himself :

D. O. No. 66/10/81-Jus. Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs, India, New Delhi - 100 001 March 18, 1981 My dear It has repeatedly been suggested to government over the years by several bodies and forums including the States Reorganisation Commission, the Law Commission and various Bar Associations that to further national integration and to combat narrow parochial tendencies bred by caste, Kinship and other local links and affiliations, one-third of the Judges of a High Court should as far as possible be from outside the State in which that High Court is situated. Somehow, no start could be made in the past in this direction. The feeling is strong, growing and justified that some effective steps should be taken very early in this direction.
2. In this context, I would request you to -
(a) obtain from all the Additional judges working in the High Court of your State their consent to be appointed as permanent Judges in any other High Court in the country. They could, in addition, be requested to name three High Courts, in order of preference, to which they would prefer to be appointed as permanent Judges; and(b) obtain from persons who have already been or may in the future be proposed by you for initial appointment their consent to be appointed to any other High Court in the country along with a similar preference for three High Courts.
2. Chief Ministers (by name) (Except North-Eastern States) It appears that a copy of the Circular letter was sent by the Law Minister to the Chief Justice of each High Court and the Chief Minister of each State also forwarded a copy of the circular letter to the Chief Justice of the High Court of his State. We do not know what the Chief Justices of the various High Courts did on receipt of a copy of the circular letter from the Law Minister and from the Chief Ministers of their respective States, but presumably each Chief Justice sent a copy of the circular letter to the Additional Judges in his court with a request to do the needful in view of what was stated in the circular letter. The Chief Justice of Bombay High Court in any even addressed such a communication to each of the Additional Judges in his Court. We do not know what was the response of the Additional Judges in Bombay to the circular letter but the record shows that out of the total number of Additional Judges in the country, quite a few Additional Judges gave their consent to be appointed outside their High Court. The petitioners and other advocates practising on the original as well as appellate side of the High Court of Bombay however took the view that the circular letter was a direct attack on the independence of the judiciary which is a basic feature of the Constitution and hence the Advocates Association of Western India which represents advocates practising on the appellate side, the Bombay Bar Association which represents advocates practising on the original side and the Managing Committee of the Bombay Incorporated Law Society which represents Solicitors practising in the High Court of Bombay, passed resolutions condemning the circular letter as subversive of judicial independence and asking the Government of India to withdraw the circular letter. Since the circular letter was not withdrawn by the Law Minister, the petitioners filed the present writ petition in the High Court of Bombay challenging the constitutional validity of the circular letter and seeking a declaration that if consent has been given by any Additional Judge or by any person whose name has been or is to be submitted for appointment as a Judge, consequent on or arising form the circular letter, it should be held to be null and void. There were several grounds on which the constitutional validity of the circular letter was challenged but it is not necessary to set them out at the present stage because we shall have occasion to refer to them in detail when we deal with the rival arguments of the parties. The petitioners impleaded the Law Minister as respondent 1, the Union of India as respondent 2 and ten Additional Judges of the Bombay High Court as respondents 3 to 12. The writ petition was filed on April 20, 1981 and immediately after filing it, the petitioners applied to the learned single Judge sitting on the original side of the Bombay High Court for admission of the writ petition and interim relief. The admission of the writ petition as also the grant of interim relief were opposed on behalf of respondents 1 and 2 but the learned single Judge admitted the writ petition and issued a rule and granted interim relief in terms of prayer (e) of the writ petition. The effect of granting the interim relief was that respondents 1 and 2 were restrained from further implementing the circular letter and acting in any manner upon the consent, if any, obtained from any person following on or arising from the circular letter. Respondents 1 and 2 thereupon preferred an appeal Division Bench of the Bombay High Court under clause (15) of the Letters Patent but the appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench on April 24, 1981. The Division Bench fixed the hearing of the writ petition before the learned single Judge hearing writ petitions on June 25, 1981 and also gave directions for filing of affidavits by the parties. Respondents 1 and 2 being aggrieved by the order made by the Division Bench dismissing their appeal made an application to this Court on May 8, 1981 for taking up their special leave petition directed against the order of the Division Bench on the same day, but this Court refused to take up the special leave petition for hearing on that day and directed that it may come up for hearing in due course. Respondents 1 and 2 in the meanwhile filed Transfer Petition No. 24 of 1981 for transfer of the writ petition from the Bombay High Court to this Court under Article 139-A of the Constitution and ultimately by an order dated June 9, 1981, the Vacation Judge directed that the writ petition be withdrawn from the Bombay High Court to this Court and he also gave directions for filing of affidavits and written briefs. That is how the present writ petition filed by Iqbal Chagla and others has come up for hearing before this Bench of seven Judges constituted by the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India.

3. The second writ petition is that filed by V. M. Tarkunde in the High Court of Delhi. The petitioner in this writ petition is a senior advocate practising in the Supreme Court and he has not only challenged the constitutional validity of the circular letter issued by the Law minister but also assailed the practice followed by the Central Government in appointing Additional Judges in various High Courts. The grounds on which the constitutional validity of the circular letter is challenged are the same as those taken in the first petition filed by Iqbal Chagla and others, but, so far as the complaint in respect of appointment of Additional Judges is concerned, this writ petition covers new ground not treated by the first writ petition. What made it necessary to include this complaint in the writ petition was the fact that three Additional Judges of Delhi High Court, namely, O. N. Vohra, S. N. Kumar and S. B. Wad who had originally been appointed as Additional Judges for a period of two years with effect from March 7, 1979, and whose term was expiring on the midnight of March 6, 1981 were further appointed as Additional Judges for a period of three months only from March 7, 1981 and these short-term appointments were, according to the petitioner, unjustified by the terms of Article 224 and were in any event subversive of the independence of the judiciary. The petitioner therefore claimed in the writ petition, in addition to the declaration that the circular letter was unconstitutional and void, a writ of mandamus directing the Central Government to convert the posts of Additional Judges into permanent Judges in the various High Courts commensurate with the regular business and the arrears in those high Courts and in particular to convert 12 posts of Additional Judges in the Delhi High Court into permanent posts having regard to the regular business and the large arrears in that High Court. The petitioner also questioned the validity of short- term appointments of O. N. Vohra, S. N. Kumar and S. B. Wad and claimed that since there was an existing vacancy in a permanent post, O. N. Vohra should be appointed as a permanent Judge to fill that vacancy and so far as S. N. Kumar and S. B. Wad were concerned, they should be appointed for the full term of two years. It appears that the Union of India was the only respondent impleaded in the writ petition as originally filed, but subsequently the Law Minister as also the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs were added as respondents 2 and 3 to the writ petition. The High Court of Delhi by its order dated April 23, 1981 admitted the writ petition and issued rule upon it. However, since the questions arising in the writ petition were questions of great constitutional importance and the first writ petition had already been filed in the Bombay High Court and another writ petition to which we shall presently refer had also been presented in the High Court of Allahabad raising substantially the same questions, an application was made to this Court on April 24, 1981 for transfer of the writ petition to this Court and by an order dated May 1, 1981 this Court transferred the writ petition to itself from the Delhi High Court. Meanwhile, the further terms of O. N. Vohra, S. N. Kumar and S. B. Wad was about to expire on June 6, 1981 and no decision appeared to have been taken till then for continuing these three Additional Judges for a further term and the petitioner apprehended that if these three Additional Judges were not continued as Additional Judges on the expiration of their term on June 6, 1981, the writ petition might become infructuous. The petitioner therefore, presented an application to this Court on May 4, 1981 for an order directing that the writ petition be heard and disposed of before June 6, 1981 and that in any event, the respondents should maintain status quo by extending the period of appointment of Additional Judges in the various High Courts till the disposal of the writ petition. Immediately on filing this application the petitioner requested the Court to fix an early date of hearing of the writ petition so that it could be disposed of before June 6, 1981, but since the Court was closing for the summer vacation from May 9, 1981, it was not possible to fix the hearing of the writ petition till the reopening of the Court after the summer vacation. The petitioner thereupon prayed for an interim order that on the expiration of their term on June 6, 1981, the Additional Judges should be continued and their term extended until the final disposal of the writ petition. But, obviously this was not a prayer which could be granted by the Court because it is for the President and not for the Court to appoint Additional Judges and once the term of an Additional Judge has come to an end by efflux of time, it is not competent for the court to reappoint him for a further term. Since, however, an allegation was made in the application that the appointments of Additional Judges for a further term were being made at the last minute and three Additional Judges of the Bombay High Court at Nagpur were not informed about the extension of their term until the evening of the last day on which their original term was due to expire, this Court made an order dated May 8, 1981 directing that, since the hearing of the writ petition would not be taking place until the reopening of the court after the summer vacation, the Union of India should ""decide not less than ten days before June 6, 1981 whether any of the three Additional Judges should be reappointed for a further term as Additional Judges or they should be appointed as permanent Judges or otherwise"" . So far as the circular letter was concerned, though on prayer for interim relief was made in the written application, this Court, on an oral application made on behalf of the petitioner, directed that any Additional Judge who does not wish to respondent to the circular letter may do so until the disposal of the writ petition and he shall not be refused extension nor shall he be refused permanent appointment, as the case may be, on the ground that he has not sent any reply to the circular letter or has not indicated his preference as asked for in the circular letter. Now, according to this order, the Central Government was bound to take its decision in regard to the continuance or otherwise of O. N. Vohra, S. N. Kumar and S. B. Wad on or before May 27, 1981 but since no such decision was communicated to the three Additional Judges, the petitioner, presuming that such decision must not have been reached by the Central Government preferred an application to the Court on June 1, 1981 for directing the Central Government to communicate its decision regarding the continuance or otherwise of the three Additional Judges. Before this application came up for hearing, the petitioner came to know that a decision had been taken by the Central Government in regard to O. N. Vohra, S. N. Kumar and S. B. Wad and while S. B. Wad was continued as an Additional Judge for a period of one year from June 7, 1981, O. N. Vohra and S. N. Kumar were not continued for a further term. The petitioner thereupon preferred another application to this Court on June 4, 1981 and in this application the petitioner pointed out that there were still large arrears of work in the Delhi High Court and therefore there was no lawful and bona fide reason for the non-continuance of O. N. Vohra and S. N. Kumar and not granting fresh appointments to them was mala fide and unconstitutional and prayed that in the circumstances, an interim order should be made by the Court directing that O. N. Vohra and S. N. Kumar shall continue to function as Judges of the Delhi High Court. Both these applications came up for hearing before the learned Vacation Judge and by an order dated June 6, 1981, the learned Vacation Judge declined to grant interim relief that O. N. Vohra and S. N. Kumar shall continue as Additional Judges but directed that notice be issued to show cause why status quo in respect of these two Judges should not be maintained and continued till the pendency of the writ petition. It appears that no order was thereafter made on the notice, since the writ petition itself was directed to be heard at an early date and in the meanwhile, O. N. Vohra and S. N. Kumar were impleaded as respondents 4 and 5, to the writ petition. O. N. Vohra did not appear at the hearing of the writ petition but S. N. Kumar appeared through counsel, filed a counter-affidavit and claimed that the decision of the Central Government not to appoint him for a further term was vitiated since it was reached without full and effective consultation with the Chief Justice of India and in any event it was based on irrelevant considerations and that on a proper construction of Article 224 read with Article 217, he must be deemed to have been appointed as a permanent Judge and in any event, he was entitled to be appointed as an Additional Judge for a further term. The Union of India also filed an affidavit in answer to the writ petition and a further affidavit in reply to the counter-affidavit of S. N. Kumar. The writ petition was thereafter placed for hearing before this Bench of seven Judges along with the writ petition filed by Iqbal Chagla and others.

10. The eighth writ petition is that filed by D. N. Pandey and Thakur Ramapati Sinha, two advocates practising in the High Court of Patna. This writ petition was originally filed in the High Court of Patna under Article 226 and it challenged the constitutional validity of the Orders transferring Chief Justice M. M. Ismail to the Kerala High Court and Chief Justice K. B. N. Singh to the Madras High Court. The averments and prayers made in this writ petition are substantially the same as those made in the fifth, sixth and seventh writ petitions filed respectively by Miss Lilly Thomas, A. Rajappa and P. Subramanian and it is therefore not necessary to repeat them. Suffice it to state that this writ petition was also transferred to this Court along with the other writ petitions under Article 139-A. Whilst this writ petition was pending, Chief Justice K. B. N. Singh, who was originally impleaded as respondent 3 in the writ petition, applied for being transposed, as petitioner 3 and since the original petitioners had no objection to Chief Justice K. B. N. Singh joining them as co- petitioner, this Court made an Order on September 17, 1981 transposing Chief Justice K. B. N. Singh as petitioner 3. Chief Justice K. B. N. Singh thereafter filed an affidavit setting out in extenso what transpired between him and the Chief Justice of India in regard to the proposal for his transfer and detailing the various grounds on which he contended that the order transferring him as Chief Justice of the Madras High Court was unconstitutional and void. Chief Justice K. B. N. Singh contended inter alia that the order transferring him as Chief Justice of the Madras High Court was passed by the President by way of punishment and it was based on irrelevant and insufficient grounds and was not in public interest and in any event, it was not preceded by full and effective consultation with the Chief Justice of India. The averments made by Chief Justice K. B. N. Singh in this affidavit were disputed by the Union of India in an affidavit sworn by K. C. Kankan, Deputy secretary, Department of Justice, Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs and the Chief Justice of India also filed a counter-affidavit in reply to the affidavit of Chief Justice K. B. N. Singh. The counter-affidavit of the Chief Justice of India prompted two affidavits in rejoinder, one by Chief Justice K. B. N. Singh and the other by petitioner 1 and 2. We shall have occasion to refer to these various affidavits when we deal with rival arguments advanced on behalf of the parties.

35. It is clear from the discussions which took place in the Constituent Assembly that the Constitution-makers realised that an acting or Additional Judge would have to go back to the Bar on the expiration of his term of office and his tenure was of a strictly limited duration. The Constitution- makers did not oppose the practice of appointing acting or Additional Judge on the ground that on the expiration of his term of office, an acting or Additional Judge would have to go back to the Bar, but their anxiety was that after going back to the Bar he would resume his practice and this might lead to abuses and it was this undesirable consequence which they wanted to prevent and that is why they deleted Articles 198(2) and 199 with a view to abolishing the practice of appointing acting or Additional Judges. The underlying postulate of Articles 198(2) and 199 was that an acting or Additional Judges would come back to the Bar on the expiration of his term and start practice and this was intended to be stopped, but since it was not possible to debar an acting or Additional Judge from practising after he came back on the expiration of term, it was decided that the institution of acting and Additional Judges should be done away with. There was no assumption by the Constitution-makers that an acting or Additional Judge would necessarily be made permanent and he would not have to go back to the Bar. On the contrary, going back to the Bar was clearly contemplated and hence Article 198(2) and 199 were deleted. The Constitution-makers also thought that it would be possible to discontinue the system of appointing acting and Additional Judges altogether without any detriment to early disposal of cases, if the total number of permanent Judges was sufficiently increased.

(ii) As Acting Chief Justice he constituted the Benches for the second half of 1980 putting Justice Kumar in a Division Bench on the Appellate Side which he thought"" was a safe way to finish the rumours if the same were incorrect and thus safeguard the reputation of a Judge"". However"" Justice Kumar did not release the original suits, regarding which allegations had been made, from his board "". The particulars of the suits and the names of the parties were mentioned in the letter.(iii) In August 1980 the same colleague of his who had talked to him earlier regarding Shri Kumar's integrity and another colleague mentioned that"" doubts were being expressed about the integrity of Justice Kumar vis-a-vis the aforesaid cases and some other "". He made discreet inquires from some of the leading counsel and they in strict confidence supported the allegations. Looking into the matter more carefully he found that"" it was not only the three suits mentioned above but that there were other Single Bench matters also which had been retained by Justice Kumar on his board despite being put in the Division Bench.... In some of these the parties involved were rich and influential including some former Princes"".

143. The petitions shall be disposed of in accordance with the conclusions reached on the various points arising for decision in these petitions.

144. The petitioners, Advocates practising in the High Court of Bombay, filed a Writ Petition No. 527 of 1981 before the Bombay High Court challenging the constitutionality of Ex. 'A', a circular said to have been issued by the Union Law Minister on March 18, 1981 and addressed to the Governor of Punjab and Chief Ministers of States (except the North-Eastern States). The petitioners prayed for several reliefs to which we shall refer hereafter. The writ petition was transferred to this Court with the consent of the parties by an order dated June 9, 1981.

145. The petitioners alleged that the Union Law Minister who was respondent 1 in the original writ petition had issued a circular letter dated March 18, 1981 (hereafter referred to as the 'circular') to the Governor of Punjab and the Chief Ministers of States requesting them to obtain the consent of Additional Judges of the High Courts concerned to their transfer as permanent Judges of High Courts other than those in which they were appointed as Additional Judges. We shall give details of this circular when we deal with it. The circular was received by the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court on March 29, 1981 and on March 30, 1981 he addressed a letter to the Additional Judge (respondents 3 to 12) and asked them to do the needful. The said circular seems to have created a serious upheaval in the rank and file of the lawyers of Bombay Bar resulting in a special general meeting of the Advocates Association of Western India on April 3, 1981. It is alleged in the petition that the meeting was largely attended and a unanimous resolution was passed, inter alia, condemning the circular as being subversive of judicial independence and demanding that the government be directed to withdraw the circular. The furore on the circular seems to have infiltrated into the Bombay Bar Association which also held several meetings and similar resolutions were passed. On April 14, 1981 a meeting of the Managing Committee of the Bombay Incorporated Society passed similar resolutions and also resolved that the President of the Society should join as a petitioner, as a result of which the fourth petitioner was added as one of the petitioners. As a mark of serious protest against the circular and the discourteous language in which the said document (circular) is alleged to have been expressed, the legal practitioners practising in the High Court, city civil courts, Small Cause Courts and the police courts resolved not to attend those courts on April 15, 1981. The petitioners further alleged that they represented a large body of legal opinion of Bombay as also representing public interest in a free and independent judiciary which was the very bulwark of the democratic form of Government contemplated by the Constitution. In the writ petition, which has now been transferred to this Court, the petitioners sought the following reliefs :(a) that it may be declared that the said letter, Ex.'A' to the petition, is ultra vires and void;

148. Apart from these apprehensions the petitioner made serious allegations the purport of which was that a consistent campaign had been launched by some of the Ministers of Central Government and Chief Ministers of States against the higher judiciary. In this connection, statements of a Cabinet Minister and some Chief Ministers were mentioned. Referring to some concrete cases it was alleged that although permanent vacancies in the High Court of Delhi were available yet Justice Goswami and Justice Sultan Singh instead of being made permanent Judges were appointed as Additional Judges for a period of two years in July and August 1980 respectively whereas Justice Vohra as an Additional Judge only for three months. It was further alleged that two more Additional Judges, viz., Justice Kumar and Justice Wad were appointed for three months. According to the allegations made by the petitioner, the terms of the aforesaid three Judges, Justices Vohra, Kumar and Wad was to expire on June 6, 1981. It appears that after the term of Justice Vohra and Justice Kumar expired on June 6, 1981, the Central Government did not reappoint them as a result of which they were sent back to the Bar. Justice Vohra did not file any petition and instead started his practice.

499. Although the facts of this case are quite different from the facts of the present case, yet the case cited above undoubtedly recognised administration of justice as a fundamental public interest. Once this is so, then by the force of Section 123 of the Evidence Act, disclosure cannot be permitted and the Government would be entitled to take the plea of privilege.

502. Thus, what the House of Lords held was that the element of confidentiality in the documents was not so acute or sensitive as to create any public interest. On the other hand, public interest itself in the circumstances required disclosure. This case, therefore is of no assistance to the petitioners because the facts of the present case are essentially different from the facts of the case. In the instant case, after inspection of the documents it cannot be said that only private interests were involved and that there was no injury to public interest. The disclosure of the confidential notes and correspondence between three very high constitutional functionaries, viz., CJI, Law Minister and the CJ, Delhi High Court containing matters on which no public debate could be allowed were undoubtedly matters of great public interest. On the other hand, the interest of Justice Kumar was a purely individual interest which must yield to public interest. On the face, therefore, of the ratio of this case, the plea of privilege would have to be upheld straight away.

I cannot help commending the conduct of Justice Ismail who actually resigned and chose to quit his office instead of pursuing the matter further in the larger interest of the purity of administration of justice. The life of a judge is that of a hermit and he must inculcate a spirit of self-sacrifice and should take his profession in this holy spirit.

526. At any rate, without going into further details as several constitutional functionaries were involved, two facts emerge :

(1) That CJ, Delhi who had undoubtedly a better chance of observing the performance and the functioning of Justice Kumar, was in a position to get firsthand knowledge of his reputation, has honestly believed that Kumar's reputation of integrity was doubtful. He has not revealed the sources from which he came to know about the reputation of Justice Kumar. The CJI, however, took a contrary view but he has also not disclosed the names of the lawyers or Judges who had given him a contrary version.
547. By virtue of a notification dated January 19, 1981, the petitioner was informed that the President, after consultation with the CJI, was pleased to transfer him to Madras High Court as Chief Justice with effect from the date he assumes charge of that office. A similar notification was issued by which Justice M. M. Ismail, CJ, Madras High Court was transferred as CJ of the Kerala High Court but as Justice Ismail proceeded on leave and ultimately retired from service the petition which was filed against the order transferring him to Kerala no longer survives. Miss Lily Thomas who appeared on behalf of Justice Ismail, however, confined her arguments only to the question that the petitioner (Justice K. B. N. Singh) should not have been transferred to Madras.

553. As a plea for disclosure of the documents in the nature of correspondence which led to the transfer of the petitioner from Patna to Madras was also prayed for, a counter-affidavit was filed by Shri T. N. Chaturvedi, Home Secretary opposing the disclosure and taking the plea of privilege under Sections 123 and 124 of the Evidence Act. The court by a majority of 6 : 1, as in other cases, in this case also overruled the plea of privilege and directed disclosure of the documents concerning the correspondence but omitting the notes and some minutes which fell within the ambit of Article 74(2) of the Constitution. The Hon'ble CJI, who is respondent 2, filed his counter-affidavit on September 29, 1981, as directed by us, where he denied or rebutted most of the allegations of fact made by the petitioner in his affidavit. The petitioner filed another rejoinder on October 16, 1981 to the counter-affidavit of the CJI.

556. The CJI further states that he did have a talk over the telephone with the petitioner on January 5, 1981 and apprised him of the likelihood of his being transferred to Madras and asked him if he had anything to say. The CJI denied that he merely said that the petitioner was being sent to Madras in view of the Government policy but added that apart from the Government policy he had expressly told him that it was proposed to transfer him to Madras because he was an experienced and senior Chief Justice. The CJI admits that the petitioner had informed him that his mother was bedridden and not in a position to go to Madras but he did not tell him (CJI) about any other difficulty. The CJI further states that the petitioner had hinted that if his transfer was insisted upon he would prefer to resign. Thereupon, he (CJI) requested him not to act in haste and to give the matter a close thought. He also informed the petitioner that he was making a note of the difficulty expressed by him. He also requested him to come to Delhi and discuss the question of his transfer. The CJI further states that the petitioner met him in Delhi three/four days later and was with him for 10-15 minutes and acquainted him (CJI) of his acute and insurmountable personal difficulties in the event of his transfer to Madras. The CJI further admitted that the petitioner was at his residence on January 8, 1981 at 7.30 p.m. and during their discussion the question of his mother's advanced age and illness also came up which was the only personal difficulty stressed by him (petitioner). The CJI told him that he was unable to agree with him because there were other dependable persons in the family, including his brother S. B. N. Singh, who could look after his mother. The CJI also states that the petitioner gave him an impression that perhaps some complaints may have been made against him to the CJI which he would like to remove, on which the CJI assured him that he did not believe that his conduct was in any way blameworthy but certain persons were exploiting their proximity to him which had created needless misunderstanding and dissatisfaction. Other matters were also mentioned by the petitioner to the CJI which have no direct bearing on the issue.

745. Ordinarily an Additional Judge save in rare cases was always offered a permanent judgeship unless he himself wanted to opt out. In order to curb and thwart an undesirable practice of a person returning to the Bar after adorning the Bench for a short time, a system of taking an undertaking from an Additional Judge, that if offered he will accept the permanent judgeship was commenced upon a note of the former Chief Justice of India, Mr. Wanchoo, though the practice does not appear to be universal. The tendency to return to the Bar after adorning the Bench for some time was to be thwarted. The undertaking was devised to meet this situation. This would however show that save in rare exceptional case, first appointment was as an Additional Judge. An Additional Judge will have a fixed tenure and can safely return to Bar with a perceptible added advantage because it was felt that there was no other way except to offer first appointment as an Additional Judge, and therefore a system of taking the undertaking was devised. But again save in rare exceptional cases an Additional Judge on the occurring of a vacancy in the permanent strength was always offered a berth. From this invariable practice, a firm belief, therefore, developed that an Additional Judge enters upon office with almost an unwritten albeit incontrovertible assurance to be appointed a permanent Judge. Howsoever strong the belief may be, it is not borne out by the constitutional provision. After all, the appointment was as an Additional Judge within the constraints and limitation of Article 224 and no canon of construction would permit the court to treat the appointment as one under Article 217. If, therefore, the tenure was of two years, on the expiry of it the appointment will have to be a fresh appointment and for making such a fresh appointment, consultation as ordained by Article 217 is inescapable. Once the consultation starts, all possible hazards in the process of consultation cannot be wished away and the appointment has to be afresh.

board, I give below some facts.In the first half of 1980, Justice Kumar was sitting singly and was doing mostly original side matters but also some appellate side matters. Chance remarks came to my knowledge about his conduct in Court as well as about his integrity. Somewhere early in May, 1980, one of my colleagues met me and said that he was rather perturbed about information with him to the effect that if a substantial amount was paid to Justice Kumar, suits brought by a particular party against an insurance company would be decided in favour of that party. I had not paid much attention to the earlier reports but when this was brought to my notice, and I was at that time not the Chief Justice, I thought to myself that after the summer vacations, to save Justice Kumar from any embarrassment, he should be put on a jurisdiction other than original jurisdiction. Therefore, when as Acting Chief Justice I constituted the Benches for the second half of 1980 I put Justice Kumar in a Division Bench to sit on the appellate side and writ jurisdiction. In my view this was a safe way to finish the rumours if the same were incorrect and thus safeguard the reputation of a Judge. Surprisingly enough, Justice Kumar did not release the original suits, regarding which allegations had been made, from his broad and continued to deal with these suits even in the second half of 1980. These suits were Suit No. 1409 of 1979, Suit No. 1417 of 1978 and Suit No. 1408 of 1979 filed by Jain Sudh Vanaspati Ltd. and Jain Export Pvt. Ltd. against the New India Assurance Co. Ltd. In August, 1980, the same colleague of mine who talked to me earlier and another colleague mentioned that doubts were being expressed about the integrity of Justice Kumar vis-a-vis the aforesaid cases and some others. Since I was only acting as Chief Justice at that time, I did not want to take any precipitate action. I, however, made discreet inquires from some of the leading counsel and they in strict confidence supported the allegations. This made me look into the matter more carefully when to my astonishment I found that it was not only the three suits mentioned above but that there were other Single Bench matters also which had been retained by Justice Kumar on his board despite being put in the Division Bench. There is fairly a long list of those cases. In some of these the parties involved were rich and influential including some former princes. After I was appointed Chief Justice early in January, 1981, I looked into this matter a little more deeply and made further inquiries. Some of the lawyers were non-committal and understandably so. Others, however, asserted with some force that Justice Kumar's reputation was not above-board. I talked to some of my other colleagues besides the two who had earlier spoken to me. They also said that unconfirmed reports have been circulating in the Bar which were not very complimentary to Justice Kumar. This made me conclude that the reputation for integrity of Justice Kumar was not what should be for a Judge of the High Court. To my mind, reputation of integrity is just as important as a person actually being above-board.Then followed reference to a complaint made by one Mr. Sabir Hussain, Advocate and some data concerning the disposal of cases by Shri S. N. Kumar as well as allegations about some incidents in his Court concerning his conduct towards counsel.

974. It appears that Order 53 was designed to stop technical procedural arguments of many types which had marred the true administration of justice, and to provide a machinery to determine at the preliminary stage of the granting of leave to prosecute an application for judicial review, whether the applicant has a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates. The phrase 'sufficient interest' which, it is stated, owed its origin to an interlocutory observation made by the Court in R v. Cotham (1898 1 QB 802, 804 : 67 LJQB 632 : 46 WR 512) and to its use by Avory, J. in his judgment in Ex parte Stott [1916] 1 K.B. 7, 9 : 85 LJKB 502 : 114 LT 234 (DC)) embraced all kinds of phrases 'a party', 'a person aggrieved', 'a person with a particular grievance' etc. used in various cases where the locus standi of the applicant concerned was questioned. After the aforesaid Order 53 came into force the application out of which the case Inland Revenue Commissioners v. National Federation of Self- Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. [1982] A.C. 617 (HL)) decided on April 9, 1981 by the House of Lords arose was instituted before the Queen's Bench. The facts of the case were these : There was a long standing practice in Fleet Street for casual employees on national newspapers to receive their wages without deduction of tax and to supply fictitious names and addresses when drawing their pay in order to avoid tax. Their true identities were known only to their unions which operated a closed shop and controlled all casual employment on the newspapers. In order to prevent the evasion of tax by the casual employees, the Revenue made a special arrangement with the employers, the employees and the unions whereby the employees were required to register with the Revenue and submit tax returns for the previous two years (1977-78 and 1978-79) in return for an undertaking by the Revenue that they would not investigate tax evaded prior to 1977. The applicant, a federation of self-employed persons and small businessmen which claimed to represent a body of taxpayers, applied for judicial review under RSC, Order 53 seeking (i) a declaration that the Revenue had acted unlawfully in making the arrangement and (ii) an order of mandamus directing the Revenue to assess and collect tax on the newspaper employees as required by law. The Revenue opposed the application on the ground that the applicant did not have 'a sufficient interest in the matter' relating to the application, as required by Order 53, Rule 3(5) for the Court to grant it the necessary leave to apply for judicial review. The Divisional Court upheld that contention and refused the applicant leave. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal which held that, as a preliminary issue and on the assumption that the Revenue had acted unlawfully, the applicant was not a mere busybody but had a genuine grievance and therefore had a sufficient interest for the purpose of Rule 3(5). The Revenue appealed contending that the duties imposed on them by the tax legislation, including in particular the duty of confidentiality as between the Revenue and each individual taxpayer, precluded the possibility of any other taxpayer or group of taxpayers from having any 'sufficient interest' in the performance by the Revenue of their statutory duties. The House of Lords held inter alia that whether an applicant for mandamus had a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application related, for the purposes of Order 53, Rule 3(5) depended on whether the definition (statutory or otherwise) of the duty alleged to have been breached or not performed expressly or impliedly gave the applicant the right to complain of the breach or non-performance. Since the tax legislation, far from expressly or impliedly conferring on a taxpayer the right to make proposals about another's tax or to inquire about such tax, in fact indicated the reverse by reason of the total confidentiality of assessments and negotiations between individuals and the Revenue, and since on the evidence the Revenue in making the impugned arrangement were genuinely acting in the care and management of taxes under the powers entrusted to them, the application made by the applicant should be dismissed because the applicant did not have a sufficient interest for the purposes of Rule 3(5), or (per Lord Diplock) because it had not been shown that the Revenue had acted ultra vires or unlawfully in making the arrangement. Lord Wilberforce added that as a matter of general principle a taxpayer had no sufficient interest in asking the Court to investigate the tax arrears of another taxpayer or to complain that the latter had been underassessed or overassessed; indeed there was a strong public interest that he should not. Accordingly the appeal was allowed and the original application was dismissed.975. In Canada, however, the rule has been that the principle requiring personal standing applies to legislation of a regulatory character which affects particular persons or classes but where no particular persons or classes are affected more than others, where the issue is justiciable and where the nature of the case is suitable the Court may grant declaratory relief to any citizen at its discretion as can be seen from the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Thorson v. Attorney-General of Canada (No. 2) (1974 43 DLR (3d) 1). Dealing with the right of a taxpayer to dispute the constitutional validity of the Official Languages Act in Canada, Laskin, J. observed in that case thus :

It is not the alleged waste of public funds alone that will support standing but rather the right of the citizenry to constitutional behaviour by Parliament, where the issue in such behaviour is justiciable legal question.
976. In Australia the prevailing view appears to be that in matters affecting public generally in order to maintain a petition for the issue of a direction to an administrative authority to act according to law"" while something less than an enforceable right would be sufficient, there nevertheless must be some special right in the prosecutor, over and above those held by the public at large or by all members of a particular class to which he belongs "". (Vide W. Friedmann : PRINCIPLES OF AUSTERALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, 2nd Edn., p. 180)
977. The question of locus standi of a petitioner under Article 226 of the Constitution was considered by this Court in Godde Venkateswara Rao v.",Constitutional Case
"3. Brief facts which led to filing of these appeals are as follows: Punjab Public Service Commission issued advertisement for filling up 52 posts of Punjab Civil Services (Judicial Branch) vide advertisement dated 07.03.2007. Out of 52 posts, 27 posts were for General Category; 25 posts for reserved category which included 03 posts for Ex-servicemen; 02 posts for Physically Handicapped; 10 posts for Scheduled Castes; 03 posts for Scheduled Caste Ex-servicemen; 05 posts for Backward Classes; 01 post for Backward Class Ex-servicemen and 01 post for Sports Person. Preliminary examination was conducted on 27.05.2007. The main examination was conducted from 20th to 22nd July, 2007. The viva voce was conducted from 28th to 30th November, 2007 and final result was declared on 01.12.2007. 27 candidates from general category, 10 candidates from scheduled castes and 05 candidates from backward classes were declared successful and have joined in terms of letters of appointment issued to them. Eight posts were de-reserved in respect of the remaining unfilled vacant posts. As against the said de-reserved posts, seven candidates from the general category i.e. candidates upto Sl. No.34 and 01 candidate from backward classes were offered appointments. However, three candidates belonging to general category namely Sumit Garg, Vijayant Sehgal and Yogesh Chaudhary placed at Sl. No.1, 5 and 32 respectively did not join the service. Resultantly, thirty one general category candidates accepted the appointment and joined service.

4. The appellants, who belong to general category have appeared in preliminary examination and subsequently in the main examination including viva voce figured in the final merit list as they stood at Sl. Nos. 37 and 36 and Parminder Singh Grewal at Sl. No. 35. Since three candidates did not join service, the appellants submitted the representation on 02.04.2008 to the High Court for issuance of appointment orders to them. The representation of the appellants was considered in the sixteenth meeting of the Administrative Committee held on 08.12.2010 and it was resolved to recommend the names of the appellants subject to approval of the Full Court. Again the matter was considered in the eighteenth meeting of the Administrative Committee held on 06.07.2011 wherein it was decided that the appellants cannot be offered appointments due to lack of vacancies. In Punjab, there was an ongoing litigation regarding selection of the judicial officers (Junior Division) in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 (known as Sidhu scam). In the said litigation in C.W.P. No.1626 of 2003, as per the order of the Supreme Court, twenty two candidates were to be appointed. At that time in the Punjab Judicial Service, only six posts were available and therefore sixteen temporary posts were sanctioned by the Punjab Government on 22.07.2008 with a specific condition that those temporary posts shall be adjusted against the vacancies created due to future retirements/promotions/vacancies etc. and these sixteen posts shall be abolished one by one as and when a vacancy is available. In the meeting held on 06.07.2011, the Administrative Committee took note of the order of this Court and observed that three resultant vacancies of the year 2007- 2008 stood consumed with the joining of seventeen candidates of the litigation pertaining to Sidhu scam case.

5. Feeling aggrieved, appellants filed writ petitions before the High Court contending that three vacancies which remained unfilled due to non-joining of three candidates should have been offered to them as they were next in the order of merit. The High Court dismissed the writ petitions holding that the appellants have no right to be appointed against the vacancies falling vacant due to non-joining of three candidates of general category. It was further held that as against 27 vacancies available for general category candidates, 31 general category candidates have already joined and are actually working i.e. candidates much more than the vacancies advertised have been permitted to join and thus the select list of 2007-2008 stands exhausted. Aggrieved thereof, appellants have preferred these appeals. Be it noted that Parminder Singh Grewal whose writ petition also came to be dismissed by the common judgment has not preferred any appeal.",Civil Case
"4. Appellant and respondent were working together in a private company. The Respondent, who was working as a Personal Officer of the Company, was a married person having two children and the appellant, aged 33 years, was unmarried. Constant contacts between them developed intimacy and in the year 1992, appellant left the job from the above-mentioned Company and started living with the respondent in a shared household. Appellant’s family members, including her father, brother and sister, and also the wife of the respondent, opposed that live-in-relationship. She has also maintained the stand that the respondent, in fact, started a business in her name and that they were earning from that business. After some time, the respondent shifted the business to his residence and continued the business with the help of his son, thereby depriving her right of working and earning. Appellant has also stated that both of them lived together in a shared household and, due to their relationship, appellant became pregnant on three occasions, though all resulted in abortion. Respondent, it was alleged, used to force the appellant to take contraceptive methods to avoid pregnancy. Further, it was also stated that the respondent took a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- from the appellant stating that he would buy a land in her name, but the same was not done. Respondent also took money from the appellant to start a beauty parlour for his wife. Appellant also alleged that, during the year 2006, respondent took a loan of Rs.2,50,000/- from her and had not returned. Further, it was also stated that the respondent, all along, was harassing the appellant by not exposing her as his wife publicly, or permitting to suffix his name after the name of the appellant. Appellant also alleged that the respondent never used to take her anywhere, either to the houses of relatives or friends or functions. Appellant also alleged that the respondent never used to accompany her to the hospital or make joint Bank account, execute documents, etc. Respondent’s family constantly opposed their live-in relationship and ultimately forced him to leave the company of the appellant and it was alleged that he left the company of the appellant without maintaining her.

6. Respondent filed detailed objections to the application stating that it was on sympathetical grounds that he gave shelter to her in a separate house after noticing the fact that she was abandoned by her parents and relatives, especially after the demise of her father. She had also few litigations against her sister for her father’s property and she had approached the respondent for moral as well as monetary support since they were working together in a Company. The respondent has admitted that he had cohabited with the appellant since 1993. The fact that he was married and had two children was known to the appellant. Pregnancy of the appellant was terminated with her as well as her brother’s consent since she was not maintaining good health. The respondent had also spent large amounts for her medical treatment and the allegation that he had taken money from the appellant was denied. During the month of April, 2007, the respondent had sent a cheque for Rs.2,50,000/- towards her medical expenses, drawn in the name of her sister which was encashed. Further, it was stated, it was for getting further amounts and to tarnish the image of the respondent, the application was preferred under the DV Act. Before the learned Magistrate, appellant examined herself as P.W.1 and gave evidence according to the averments made in the petition. Respondent examined himself as R.W.1. Child Development Project Officer was examined as R.W.2. The learned Magistrate found proof that the parties had lived together for a considerable period of time, for about 18 years, and then the respondent left the company of the appellant without maintaining her. Learned Magistrate took the view that the plea of “domestic violence” had been established, due to the non-maintenance of the appellant and passed the order dated 21.7.2009 directing the respondent to pay an amount of Rs.18,000/- per month towards maintenance from the date of the petition.

7. Respondent, aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, filed an appeal before the Sessions Court under Section 29 of the DV Act. The Appellate Court, after having noticed that the respondent had admitted the relationship with appellant for over a period of 14 years, took the view that, due to their live-in relationship for a considerable long period, non-maintenance of the appellant would amount to domestic violence within the meaning of Section 3 of the DV Act. The appellate Court also concluded that the appellant has no source of income and that the respondent is legally obliged to maintain her and confirmed the order passed by the learned Magistrate.

20. We are, in this case, concerned with a “live-in relationship” which, according to the aggrieved person, is a “relationship in the nature of marriage” and it is that relationship which has been disrupted in the sense that the respondent failed to maintain the aggrieved person, which, according to the appellant, amounts to “domestic violence”. The respondent maintained the stand that the relationship between the appellant and the respondent was not a relationship in the nature of marriage but a live-in-relationship simplicitor and the alleged act, omission, commission or conduct of the respondent would not constitute “domestic violence” so as to claim any protection orders under Section 18, 19 or 20 of the DV Act.",Civil Case
"48. The applicant has also submitted that in the event consenting acts between two same sex adults are excluded from the ambit of Section 377 IPC, then a married woman would be rendered remediless under the IPC against her bi-sexual husband and his consenting male partner indulging in any sexual acts.

69. On the basis of the aforesaid reasons, the High Court declared Section 377 IPC violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults in private, whereas for non-consensual penile non-vaginal sex and penile non- vaginal sex involving minors, the High Court ruled that Section 377 IPC was valid.",Constitutional Case
"7. The Court allowed the application for urging additional grounds and for amendment of the writ petition on August 10, 1972 and issued notices to the Advocates-General to appear before this Court and take such part in the proceedings as they may be advised.

27. According to him, it was legitimate to assume that the Constitution-makers visualised that Parliament would be competent to make amendments in these rights so as to meet the challenge of the problems which may arise in the course of socio-economic progress and development of the country.

97. We need not consider the intermediate drafts, but in the meantime the declaration (See Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 8, page 2) was adopted at the end of April, 1949 by the Government of the various Commonwealth countries and the resolution was ratified by Constituent Assembly on May 17; 1949 after two days' debate.

114. Mr. Seervai referred to the passage from the speech of Lord Normand, at p. 467. The passage is lengthy but I may quote these sentences:

It is only when it conveys a clear and definite meaning in comparison with relatively obscure or indefinite enacting words that the preamble may legitimately prevail. If they admit of only one construction, that construction will receive effect even if it is inconsistent with the preamble, but if the enacting words are capable of either of the constructions offered by the parties, the construction which fits the preamble may be preferred.
(2) The House of the People unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer and the expiration of the said period of five years shall operate as a dissolution of the House: ...

(2) An order made as aforesaid may extend to the whole or any part of the territory of India.

208. The question which arose before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was whether Section 41 of the Bribery Amendment Act, 1958 contravened Section 29(4) of the Ceylon Constitution, and was consequently invalid. The question arose out of the following facts. The respondent, Ranasinghe, was prosecuted for a bribery offence before the Bribery Tribunal created by the Bribery Amendment Act, 1958. The Tribunal sentenced him to a term of imprisonment and fine. The Supreme Court on appeal declared the conviction and orders made against him null and inoperative on the ground that the persons composing the Tribunal were not validly appointed to the Tribunal.

The same implied limitation on the Legislature, in the field of delegation, has been invoked and applied in:

Raj Narain Singh v. Patna Administration 1955(1) SCR 290. Hari Shankar Bagla v. State of Madhya Pradesh 1955(1) SCR 380.
Vasantilal Sanjanwala v. State of Bombay 1961(1) SCR 341. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Birla Cotton Mills 1968(3) SCR 251. Garewal v. State of Punjab 1959 Supp. (1) SCR 792.
(iv) On the power confered by Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution to form a new State and amend the Constitution for that purpose limitation has been implied that the new State must-
(Emphasis supplied) The Federal system itself is the foundation of the restraint upon the use of the power to control the State...Restraints to be implied against any exercise of power by Commonwealth against State and State against Commonwealth calculated to destroy or detract from the independent exercise of the functions of the one or the other...."" (Per Dixon J.- Melbourne Corporation v. Commonwealth 74 CLR 31 at 81-2).

245. According to the Chief Justice, the Court in Engineeres' case unequivocally rejected the doctrine that there was an ""implied prohibition"" in the Constitution against the exercise in relation to a State of a legislative power of the Commonwealth once ascertained in accordance with the ordinary rules of construction, a doctrine which had theretofore been entertained and sought to be founded upon some supposed necessity of ""protection"", as it were, ""against the aggression of some outside and possibly hostile body"". The Court emphasized that if protection against an abuse of power were needed, it must be provided by the electorate and not by the judiciary. 'The one clear line of judicial inquiry as to the meaning of the Constitution must be to read it naturally in the light of the circumstances in which it was made, with knowledge of the combined fabric of the common law, and the statute law which preceded it and then lucet ipsa per see.

248. The other passages relied on by the petitioners from the judgments of the other learned Judges on the Bench in that case are as follows:

Windeyar, J.
In each case an implication means that something not expressed is to be understood. But in the one case, this involves an addition to what is expressed : in the other it explains, perhaps limits, the effect of what is expressed. It is in the latter sense that in my view of the matter, implications have a place in the interpretation of the Constitution : and I consider it is the sense that Dixon J. intended when in Australian National Airways Pty. Ltd. v. The Commonwealth (1945) 71 C.L.R. 29, he said (at p. 85) : ""We should avoid pedantic and narrow constructions in dealing with an instrument of government and I do not see why we should be fearful about making implications"". His Honour, when Chief Justice, repeated this observation in Lamshed v. Lake (1958) 99 C.L.R. 132 at p.
144. I said in Spratt v. Hermes (1965) 114 C.L.R. 226, at p. 272, that it is well to remember it. I still think so. The only emendation that I would venture is that I would prefer not to say ""making implications"", because our avowed task is simply the revealing or uncovering of implications that are already there.
251. For proposition (2) above, reference is made in the footnote to Taylor v. The Attorney-General of Queensland. 23 C.L.R. 457 The relevant passages which bear out the second proposition are:

I take the Constitution of a legislature, as the term is here used, to mean the composition, form or nature of the House of Legislature where there is only one House, or of either House if the legislative body consists of two Houses. Probably the power does not extend to authorize the elimination of the reprsentative character of the legislature within the meaning of the Act. (p. 468 per-Barton J.).
I read the words ""Constitution of such legislature"" as including the change from a unicameral to a bicameral system, or the reverse. Probably the ""representative"" character of the legislature is-a basic condition of the power relied on, and is preserved by the word ""such,"" but, that being maintained, I can see no reason for cutting down the plain natural meaning of the words in question so as to exclude the power of a self-governing community to say that for State purposes one House is sufficient as its organ of legislation."" (p. 474 per-Issacs J.).
(For proposition No. 3, see Taylor v. The Attorney-General of Queensland 23 C.L.R. 457 and Clayton v. Heffron.) [1960] 105 C.L.R. 214; 251.
254. The case of The Attorney General of Nova Scotia and The Attorney General of Canada and Lord Nelson Hotel Company Limited [1951] S.C.R.-Canada-31 furnishes another example where limitations were implied. The Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia contemplated passing an act respecting the delegation of jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to the Legislature of Nova Scotia and vice versa. The question arose whether, if enacted, the bill would be constiutionally valid since it contemplated delegation by Parliament of powers, exclusively vested in it by Section 91 of the British North America Act to the Legislature of Nova Scotia, and delegation by that Legislature of powers, exclusively vested in Provincial Legislature under Section 92 of the Act, to Parliament.

291. The contentions advanced before the Judicial Committee were:

The appellants urge : (1) That the King, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, had full power to enact a Bill repealing Section 7A.
(2) That Sub-section 6 of Section 7A of the Constitution Act is void, because : (a) The New South Wales Legislature has no power to shackle or control its successors, the New South Wales Constitution being in substance an uncontrolled ""Constitution""; (b) It is repugnant to Section 4 of the Constitution Statute of 1855; (c) It is repugnant to Section 5 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865.
298. Then he cites the passage from the Chief Justice Marshall in McCullock v. Maryland. 4 L. ed. 579; 607.

946. This case was concerned with the validity of the 18th Amendment and of certain general features of the National Prohibition Law known as Volstead Act. No reasons were given by the Court for the conclusions arrived at. The conclusions which may have some relevance for us are conclusion 4 and 5. The learned Counsel sought to deduce the reasons for these conclusions from the arguments addressed and reported in 64 L. Ed. and for the reasons given by the learned Judge in 264 Fed. Rep. 186 but impliedly rejected by the Supreme Court by reversing the decision.

394. According to him ""the permanent power of amendment, to arise at the expiry of the period of eight years, is a wholly different thing both as to the donee of the power and the manner of its exercise.

442. In James Leslie Williams v. Haines Thomas [1911] A.C. 381 the facts are given in the headnote as follows:

Under Section 4 of the New South Wales Public Service Superannuation Act, 1903, the plaintiff was awarded by the Public Service Board a gratuity of 23 # 10 $. 1 d. per mensem, calculated for each year of service from December 9, 1875, the date of his permanent employment, upto December 23, 1895; and upon his claiming to have his service reckoned up to August 16, 1902, was awarded a further gratuity of one penny in respect of each year subsequent to December 23, 1895, up to August 16, 1902, the date of the commencement of the public Service Act of that year.
515. For our purposes it is not necessary to go prior to the year 1934. It was in that year that the Indian National Congress made the demand for a Constituent Assembly as part of its policy. This demand was repeated in the Central Legislative Assembly in 1937 by the represetatives of the Congress. By what is known as the Simla Conference 1945 the Congress repeated its stand that India could only accept the Constitution drawn by the people. After the end of World War II the demand was put forward very strongly by the Indian leaders including Mahatma Gandhi. Sir Stratford Cripps representing Britain had also accepted the idea that an elected body of Indians should frame the Indian Constitution.(The facts have been taken mainly from the Indian Constitution, Cornerstone of a Nation, by Granville Austin). In September 1945 the newly elected British Labour Government announced that it favoured the creation of a constituent body in India. Elections were to be held so that the newly elected provincial legislatures could act as electoral bodies for the Constituent Assembly. A parliamentary delegation was sent to India in January 1946 and this was followed by what is known as the Cabinet Mission. There were a great deal of difficulties owing to the differences between the approach of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League led by Mr. M.A. Jinnah. The Cabinet Mission devised a plan which was announced on May 16, 1946. By the end of June, both the Muslim League and the Congress had accepted it with reservations. The Constituent Assembly was elected between July-August 1946 as a result of the suggestion contained in the statement of the Cabinet Mission. The Attlee Government's efforts to effect an agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League having failed, the partition of the country came as a consequence of the declaration of the British Government on June 3, 1947. As a mult of that declaration certain changes took place in the Constituent Assembly. There was also readjustment of representation of Indian States from time to time between December 1946 and November 1949. Many Smaller States merged into the provinces, many united to from union of States and some came to be administered as commissioner's provinces. There was thus a gradual process by which the Constituent Assembly became fully representative of the various communities and interests, political, intellectual, social and cultural. It was by virtue of Section 8 of the Indian Independence Act 1947 that the Constituent Assembly was vested with the legal authority to frame a Constitution for India.

519. We may now look at the Preamble.

567. It may be recalled that as regards the minorities the Cabinet Mission had recognised in their report to the British Cabinet on May 6, 1946 only three main communities; general, muslims and sikhs. General community included all those who were non- muslims or non-sikhs. The Mission had recommended an Advisory Committee to be set up by the Constituent Assembly which was to frame the rights of citizens, minorities, tribals and excluded areas. The Cabinet Mission statement had actually provided for the cession of sovereignty to the Indian people subject only to two matters which were; (1) willingness to conclude a treaty with His Majesty's Government to cover matters arising out of transfer of power and (2) adequate provisions for the protection of the minorities. Pursuant to the above and paras 5 and 6 of the Objectives Resolution the Constituent Assembly set up an Advisory Committee on January 24, 1947. The Committee was to consist of representatives of muslims, the depressed classes or the scheduled castes, the sikhs, christains, parsis, anglo-Indians, tribals and excluded areas besides the Hindus Constituent Assembly Debates Vol. 2 pages 330-349. As a historical fact it is safe to say that at a meeting held on May 11, 1949 a resolution for the abolition of all reservations for minorities other than the scheduled castes found whole hearted support from an overwhelming majority of the members of the Advisory Committee. So far as the scheduled castes were concerned it was felt that their peculiar position would necessitate special reservation for them for a period of ten years. It would not be wrong to say that the separate representation of minorities which had been the feature of the previous Constitutions and which had witnessed so much of communal tension and strife was given up in favour of joint electorates in consideration of the guarantee of fundamental rights and minorities rights which it was decided to incorporate into the new Constitution. The Objectives Resolution can be taken into account as a historical fact which moulded its nature and character. Since the language of the Preamble was taken from the resolution itself the declaration in the Preamble that India would be a Sovereign, Democratic Republic which would secure to all its citizens justice, liberty and equality was implemented in Parts III and IV and other provisions of the Constitution. These formed not only the essential features of the Constitution but also the fundamental conditions upon and the basis on which the various groups and interests adopted the Constitution as the Preamble hoped to create one unified integrated community. The decision of the Privy Council in the Bribery Commissioner v. Pedrick Ranasinghe [1965] A.C. 172 at pp. 193-194 will require a more detailed discussion in view of the elaborate arguments addressed on both sides based on it. But for the present all that need be pointed out is that the above language is borrowed mainly from the judgment of Lord Pearce who, after setting out Section 29 of the Ceylon Constitutional Order which gave Parliament the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the island, said with regard to Clause (2) according to which no law could prohibit or restrict the free excrcise of any religion, There follow (b), (c) and (d), which set out further entrenched religious and racial matters, which shall not be the subject of legislation. They represent the solemn balance of rights between the citizens of Ceylon, the fundamental conditions on which inter se they accepted the Constitution; and these are therefore unalterable under the Constitution.

"BHAGWATI, J.-The Petitioner is the holder of the passport issued to her on 1st June, 1976 under the Passport Act, 1967. On 4th July, 1977 the Petitioner received a letter dated 2nd July, 1977 from the Regional Passport Officer, Delhi intimating to her that it has been decided by the Government of India to impound her passport under section 10(3)(c) of the Act in public interest and requiring her to surrender the passport within seven days from the date of receipt of the letter. The petitioner immediately addressed a letter to the Regional Passport Officer requesting him to furnish a copy of the statement of reasons for making the order as provided in section 10(5) to which a reply was sent by the Government of India, Ministry of External Affairs on 6th July, 1977 stating inter alia that the Government has decided ""in the interest of the general public"" not to furnish her a copy of the statement of reasons, for making of the order. The Petitioner thereupon filed the present petition challenging the action of the Government in impounding her passport and declining to give reasons for doing so. The action of the Government was impugned inter alia on the ground that it was mala fide, but this challenge was not pressed before us at the time of the hearing of the arguments and hence it is not necessary to state any facts hearing on that question.

"Case Title: ""Exploitation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Employment Practices""

In this landmark constitutional case, the petitioner challenges discriminatory employment practices and exploitation faced by Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and other backward groups in public and private sectors. The petitioner alleges that these groups are subjected to unfair treatment, lower wages, unsafe working conditions, and lack of promotion opportunities despite legal protections guaranteed by the Indian Constitution and various statutes.

The case involves extensive evidence of systemic discrimination, testimonies from affected individuals, and a review of compliance with constitutional mandates such as Articles 15, 16, and 46. The court examines whether the existing legal frameworks and policies are effectively protecting these vulnerable groups from exploitation and discrimination.

The outcome of the case may lead to landmark judgments reinforcing protections, mandating reforms in employment practices, and ensuring stricter enforcement of anti-discrimination laws to safeguard the rights of SC, ST, and other backward groups in India. The case emphasizes the need for constitutional safeguards and remedies to address exploitation and ensure social justice.",Constitutional Case

They were reinstated in service in November, 1983.

"Factual matrix has little relevance to the issues raised and canvassed at the hearing. Petitioners 1 and 2 are retired pensioners of the Central Government, the first being a civil servant and the second being a member of the service personnel of the Armed Forces. The third petitioner is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, formed to ventilate the legitimate public problems and consistent with its objective it is espousing the cause of the pensioners all over the country. Its locus standi is in question but that is a different matter. The first petitioner retired in 1972 and on computation, his pension worked out at Rs. 675/- p.m. and along with the dearness relief granted from time to time, at the relevant time he was in receipt of monthly pension of Rs. 935/-. The second petitioner retired at or about that time and at the relevant time was in receipt of a pension plus dearness relief of Rs. 981/- p.m. Union of India has been revising and liberalising the pension rules from time to time. Some landmark changes may be noticed.

The First Central Pay Commission (1946-47) recommended that the age of retirement in future should be uniformly 58 years for all services and the scale of pension should be 1/80 of the emoluments for each year of service, subject to a limit of 35/80 with a ceiling of Rs. 8,000 per year for 35 years of service, which the Government of India while accepting the recommendation raised to Rs. 8,100 per year which would earn a monthly pension of Rs. 675 at the maximum. The Second Central Pay Commission (1957-58) re-affirmed that the age of superannuation should be 58 years for all classes of public servants but did not recommend any increase in the non- contributory retirement benefits and recommended that if in future any improvement is to be made, it was the considered view of the Commission that these benefits should be on a contributory basis. The Administrative Reforms Commission ('ARC' for short) set up by the Government of India in 1956 took note of the fact that the cost of living has shot up and correspondingly the possibility of savings has gone down and consequently the drop in wages on retirement is in reality much steeper than what the quantum of pension would indicate, and accordingly the ARC recommended that the quantum of pension admissible may be raised to 3/6 of the emoluments of the last three years of service as against the existing 3/8 and the ceiling should be raised from Rs. 675 p.m. to Rs. 1000 p.m. Before the Government could take its decision on the recommendations of the ARC, the Third Central Pay Commission was set up. One of the terms of reference of the Third Pay Commission was 'death-cum- retirement benefits of Central Government employees'. The Third Pay Commission did not examine the question of relief to pensioners because in its view unless the terms of reference were suitably amended it would not be within their jurisdiction to examine this question and on a reference by them, the Government of India decided not to amend the terms of reference. With regard to the future pensioners the Third Pay Commission while reiterating that the age of superannuation should continue to be 58 years further recommended that no change in the existing formula for computing pension is considered necessary. The only important recommendation worth noticing is that the Commission recommended that the existing ceiling of maximum pension should be raised from Rs. 675 to Rs. 1,000 p.m. and the maximum of the gratuity should be raised from Rs. 24,000 to Rs. 30,000.

On May 25, 1979, Government of India, Ministry of Finance, issued Office Memorandum No. F-19(3)-EV-79 whereby the formula for computation of pension was liberalised but made it applicable to Government servants who were in service on March 31, 1979 and retire from service on or after that date (specified date for short). The formula introduced a slab system for computation of pension. This liberalised pension formula was applicable to employees governed by the 1972 Rules retiring on or after the specified date. The pension for the service personnel which will include Army, Navy and Air Force staff is governed by the relevant regulations. By the Memorandum of the Ministry of Defence bearing No. B/40725/AG/PS4-C/1816/AD (Pension)/Services dated September 28, 1979, the liberalised pension formula introduced for the government servants governed by the 1972 rules was extended to the Armed Forces personnel subject to limitations set out in the memorandum with a condition that the new rules of pension would be effective from April 1, 1979, and may be applicable to all service officers who become/became non-effective on or after that date. (for short specified date).

The chronology of events herein narrated would bring to surface the contentions raised in these petitions. The liberalised pension formula shall be applicable prospectively to those who retired on or after March 31, 1979 in case of government servants covered by 1972 Rules and in respect of defence personnel those who became/become non-effective on or after April 1, 1979. Consequently those who retired prior to the specified date would not be entitled to the benefits of the liberalised pension formula.",Constitutional Case

"In brief the facts to the extent relevant and necessary for disposal of this appeal are as under :-

There was an agreement dated 21.2.1995 between the appellant No. 1 (the company) and the respondent no. 2 under which he was appointed as a consignment stockist of the company subject to certain terms and conditions.
The said agreement was valid till 20.2.1996. By a subsequent agreement dated S.S.1997 the same arrangement was extended up to 31.3.1997 on the same terms and conditions. On 3.10.1997 respondent No. 2 (complainant) served a notice on the Manager Marketing and Regional Manager of the company requesting them to make payment of Rs. 15.00 lacs to it within 15 days or in the alternative refer the disputes and differences to arbitration as per clause 29 of the agreement. Thereafter the parties met and the company offered to supply Ammonium Sulphate to the respondent for the period 1997-98 on certain terms. The respondent rejected the offer finding the terms unreasonable. It is thereafter the respondent filed a complaint on 8.12.1997 alleging offences under sections 406 and 420 read with Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) inter alia stating ""that the accused persons in collusion and connivance of each other with wrongful objects and motive to wrongfully squeeze money/ gratification from the complainant and in their own benefit used the complain-ant wrongly and have cheated the complainant by practising fraud and have acted fraudulently against the complainant and by doing such acts they have committed criminal breach of trust and put the complainant to wrongful loss and have gained wrongfully. The accused persons have also cheated the com-plainant by using the office and godown premises of the complainant on the basis of false assurances given to the complainant and without making any farthing for such costly and valuable premises and thus committed criminal breach of trust, fraud and cheating which caused loss of rupees fifteen lacs"".
The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patna by his order dated 6.1.1998 issued summons against the appellants. The appellants approached the High Court by filing a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing the aforemen-tioned order of the learned Magistrate. The High Court by the impugned order dismissed the said petition. In these circumstances the appellants are before this Court in appeal.
Shri Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants urged that the High Court failed to exercise its power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case in order to prevent abuse of process of the court and/or to secure the ends of justice; that the disputes between the appellants and respondent no. 2 were purely of civil nature arising out of contractual relationship relating to commercial transac-tion; even looking to the sworn statements, terms of the agreement and the notice dated 3.10.1997, no case is made out to proceed against the appellants on criminal side, that the essential ingredient of the offence under Section 405 IPC is not made out as the appellants were not entrusted with any property or with domain over property; similarly the ingredients of the offence under Section 415 & 120-B IPC also were not satisfied. According to him, the learned Magistrate committed a serious error in issuing the process; unfortunately, the High Court, also failed to correct the same, exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. Alternatively and lastly, he submitted that at any rate no case is made out against the appellants 1-6 and 8. Hence, issuing a process against them is patently illegal and untenable. Shri L.K. Bajla, learned counsel for respondent No. 2 made submissions supporting the impugned judgment of the High Court and justifying the order passed by the learned Magistrate in issuing the process. More or less, he reiterated the submissions that were made before the High Court.
Before examining respective contentions on their relative merits, we think it is appropriate to notice the legal position. Every breach of trust may not result in a penal offence of criminal breach of trust unless there is evidence of a mental act of fraudulent misappropriation. An act of breach of trust involves a civil wrong in respect of which the person wronged may seek his redress for damages in a civil court but a breach of trust with mens rea gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well.
The ingredients in order to constitute a criminal breach of trust are: (1) entrusting a person with property or with any dominion over property (ii) that person entrusted (a) dishonestly misappropriating or converting that property to his own use; or (b) dishonestly using or disposing of that property or willfully suffering any other person so to do in violation (i) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged (ii) of any legal contract made touching the discharge of such trust.
The ingredients of the offence of cheating are: (i) there should be fraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving him, (ii) (a) the person so deceived should be induced to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property; or (b) the person so deceived should be intentionally induced to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived; and
(iii) in cases covered by (ii) (b), the act of omission should be one which causes or is likely to cause damage or harm .to the person induced in body, mind, reputation or property.",Criminal Case
"JUSTICE D.P. WADHWA, J.(PRESIDENT)   It is Captain C.P. Gupta, complainant, who is petitioner before us. He joined Indian Airlines, the respondents-opposite parties, in 1976 and was governed by the Indian Airlines (Flying Crew) Service Regulations and for the provident fund by the Indian Airlines Employees Provident Fund Regulations 1955. Captain Gupta suffered some heart ailment and underwent by-pass surgery. He was declared unfit for flying duties. He was put on annuity @ 95% of his last salary plus Rs.100/- per month w.e.f. 2.4.91 till the date of his superannuation which was July, 1993. He was put on annuity with a condition that as and when he regained his relevant medical category he shall resume his flying duties. Captain Gupta had become member of the Provident Fund Scheme of the Indian Airlines under the aforesaid Service Regulations and was governed by Provident Fund Regulations. It was part of the conditions of his service.

Captain Gupta was given a cheque dated 14.6.91 for Rs 7,64,800.80 towards full and final settlement of his provident fund account. Grievance of Captain Gupta in his complaint in the District Forum was that under the relevant Provident Fund Regulations he could have kept his provident fund dues in that account for a period of 365 days from the date of his retirement. He said interest earned on provident fund deposits was free from income-tax and by the action of the Indian Airlines in sending him the cheque before the expiry of 365 days from the date of his retirement had made him not only to lose the interest as per provident fund rate but also made him to pay income tax on the interest earned during the period from 16.6.91 to July, 1994 one year after the date of retirement. He also complained that the amount was paid to him in the middle of the month and again there was a loss of interest. He calculated the loss suffered at Rs.39,449/-. A sum of Rs.414/- has also been claimed as interest on the amount of Rs.2,400/- as according to complainant this amount of Rs.2400/- has wrongly been deducted from the annuity paid to him. A sum of Rs.2500/- was claimed as compensation on account of harassment, mental tension and agony as Indian Airlines, his employer, was alleged to be deficient in rendering service to him.

District Forum relying on a circular dated 2.11.88 allowed the complaint. Against this order Indian Airlines filed appeal before the State Commission which said it was the circular dated 16.4.90 which had modified the earlier circular dated 2.11.88 was applicable and also relying on relevant provisions of Provident Fund Regulations, was of the view that complaint had no merit. It, therefore, allowed the appeal and dismissed the complaint. State Commission gave short shrift to the argument of Captain Gupta that he had not in fact retired in 1991 and he was due to retire only in 1993 and therefore, Indian Airlines was deficient in service in sending him the provident fund amount due to him from his account earlier thus putting him to loss.

"2 The Appellant assails his suspension which was effected on 30.9.2011 and has been extended and continued ever since. In November, 2006, he was posted as the Defence Estate Officer (DEO) Kashmir Circle, Jammu & Kashmir. During this tenure it was discovered that a large portion of the land owned by the Union of India and held by the Director General Defence Estates had not been mutated/noted in the Revenue records as Defence Lands. The Appellant alleges that between 2008 and 2009, Office-notes were prepared by his staff, namely, Shri Vijay Kumar, SDO-II, Smt. Amarjit Kaur, SDO-III, Shri Abdul Sayoom Technical Assistant, and Shri Noor Mohd., LDC, that approximately four acres of land were not Defence Lands, but were private lands in respect of which NOCs could be issued. These NOCs were accordingly issued by the Appellant. Thereafter, on 3.4.2010, the Appellant was transferred to Ambala Cantt. However, vide letter dated 25.1.2011 the Appellant was asked to give his explanation for issuing the factually incorrect NOCs. In his reply the Appellant admitted his mistake, denied any mala fides in issuing the NOCs, and attributed the issuance of the NOCs to the notes prepared by the subordinate staff of SDOs/Technical Officer. It was in this background that he received the Suspension Order dated 30.9.2011. Various litigation was fruitlessly initiated by the Appellant in the Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench, as well as in the Punjab & Haryana High Court, with which we are not concerned. The Appellant asserts that since the subject land was within the parameter wall of the Air Force Station, no physical transfer thereof has occurred. On 28.12.2011 the Appellant's suspension was extended for the first time for a further period of 180 days. This prompted the Appellant to approach the Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench (CAT), and during the pendency of the proceedings the second extension was ordered with effect from 26.6.2012 for another period of 180 days. The challenge to these extensions did not meet with success before the CAT. Thereafter, the third extension of the Appellant's suspension was ordered on 21.12.2012, but for a period of 90 days. It came to be followed by the fourth suspension for yet another period of 90 days with effect from 22.3.2013.",Criminal Case
"2. The grounds raised by the assessee are as under:-

""Based on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Appellant respectfully submits:
1. That on facts and in law, the Learned CIT (A) has erred in confirming that the Learned TPO has discharged his statutory onus by establishing that the conditions specified in clause (a) to (d) of Section 92C (3) of the Act have been satisfied before disregarding the arm's length price determined by the Appellant and proceeding to determine the arm's length price himself.
2. The Learned CIT (A) has grossly erred in contending that no proper evidence was submitted by the Appellant to prove that certain intra group services were actually availed by the Appellant, undermining the reasonableness of the evidence submitted by the Appellant.
3. The Learned CIT (A) by upholding the addition made by the Ld. Assessing Officer/Transfer Pricing Officer, has grossly erred in questioning the need for availing certain intra group services from its associated enterprises ('AEs'). The Learned CIT (A) has exceeded his jurisdictional reach by challenging the commercial expediency and business decisions of the Appellant and by expecting the Appellant to demonstrate any tangible/quantitative benefit from the receipt of such services.
4. The Learned CIT(A) has failed to take cognizance of the fact that certain intra group services availed by it from its associated enterprises have benefitted the Appellant in the smooth and efficient functioning of its various businesses in India and erroneously concluded that only incidental benefits were received by the Appellant from availing such services.
5. The Learned CIT(A) has grossly erred by concluding that certain intra group services received by the Appellant from its AE were 'duplicate' in nature.
6. The Learned CIT(A) has grossly erred by not giving due cognizance to the fact that the Appellant could not have availed certain intra group services from unrelated parties which were a case of business necessity and requirement for the Appellant and the associated enterprises have not provided such services in the capacity of holding company/ group company.
7. The Learned CIT (A) has failed to give due consideration to the fact that in prior years, when facts of these impugned transactions remained same as in AY 2008-09, the said transactions were considered by the Learned AO/TPO to be at arm's length in those years.
8. Without prejudice to the above grounds, the Learned CIT (A) has failed to prove that the Arm's Length Price of certain intra group services availed would depend on the benefit derived by Appellant.
9 Without prejudice to the above grounds, the Learned CIT(A) has grossly erred by assuming the arm's length price of certain intra group services to be 'Nil' and '30 percent of value o transaction' (in case of administrative services and 'administrative and technical training services') while applying the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method to benchmark the impugned transactions.
The above grounds are independent and without prejudice to each other. The Appellant craves leave to add, alter, supplement, amend, vary, withdraw or otherwise modify the ground mentioned herein above at or before the time of hearing.""

3. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the assessee is a company engaged in the business of trading of various agricultural commodities such as corn, soya bean, maize, edible oil, fertilizers, etc. It filed its return of income on 31st March, 2010 declaring an income of Rs.52,08,74,989/-. Since the assessee has entered into certain international transactions with its AE, the Assessing Officer referred the matter to the file of the TPO for determination of the ALP of the international transaction entered into by the assessee. The TPO, during the TP assessment proceedings noted that the assessee in its transfer pricing study report has classified the international transactions into two categories, namely, a) merchant trade; and

(b) other transactions. He observed that the assessee has benchmarked the international transactions relating to 'merchant trade' using TNMM as the most appropriate method. The 'other transactions' has been benchmarked using TNMM/CUP the details of which are as under:-

Type of the transaction Method selected Total Value (Rs.) Merchating trade (Purchase) TNMM using Operating Profit 27,986,417,370 Merchating trade (Sales) as PLI Value added cost 28,078,622,161 Discounting charges CUP 420,257,359 Provision of business / TNMM using Operating Profit 15,181,220 forwarding support services as PLI Operating cost Provision of support services 13,594,170 Provision of sub-advisory 31,276,283 services Availing of treasury services 559,020 Availing of administrative 2,719,190 services Cost recharge 16,817,000
4. He, therefore, issued a questionnaire to the assessee in respect of the payments made for certain intra group services. It was stated by the assessee that it has received various services such as human resources, business unit engineering, accounting and audit services, credit management and public affairs, tax services, regional network group, availing corporate IT and other services, administrative and technical support services, etc. The assessee also submitted the agreement for services and cost sharing dated 01.06.2004 and 01.06.2005 and the service agreement dated 06.01.2006. The assessee also filed documentation from Cargill stating the features and value of the IT related services for business which includes write ups on shared storage, back up, internet connection services, Cargill remote accesses services, Cargill mobile office, instant messaging, mobility solutions, mailbox restoration etc.",Administrative Case

"3. Appellant No.1 and respondent No.1, Erasmo Jack de Sequeira (now dead) were sister and brother, hereinafter referred to as appellant and respondent respectively.

4. According to the appellant, she is the sole owner and is in exclusive possession of the suit property. Her title of the said suit property was clearly admitted, and never disputed by the respondent, Erasmo Jack de Sequeira. According to the appellant, the suit property was given to her brother as a caretaker. The respondent has kept appellant, his own sister, out of her suit property for about two decades by suppressing relevant material and pertinent information from the Court and abusing the process of law.

5. Both the appellant and the respondent hail from the State of Goa and belong to one of the leading and well known families of Goa. The father of the appellant and the respondent, Dr. Jack D. Sequeira was an affluent businessman and a well-known politician of Goa. Dr. Sequeira, during his lifetime, gave a number of properties worth crores of rupees to the respondent and also gave some properties to the appellant and her sisters. The respondent was given a soft drink factory at Goa, mining leases of iron ore, agricultural lands and residential plots including one  situated at Dona Paula, which is located next to the Governor's House. Though the respondent was given properties worth several crores of rupees, he still eyed on a small property which the appellant purchased through Court auction after paying full sale consideration. The respondent-

6. The appellant urged that the suit property originally belonged to her grandmother. Under the Portuguese Law, her (grandmother's) children, i.e. two sons and a daughter (the appellant's father, uncle and aunt) got 1/3rd share each in the said suit property. The suit property of her grandmother was put to auction and this suit property in question was purchased in auction by the appellant. In the Inventory Proceedings No. 1075/935 in the year 1968, she became the exclusive owner of the suit property. Admittedly, the appellant has placed a certified copy of the order of the Civil Judge, Senior Division at Panaji dated 27th May, 1972 issued in  favour of the appellant. According to the appellant, the possession and title of the suit property in favour of the appellant is established from the judgment of the Inquiry Officer of City Survey Tiswadi, Panjim, Goa. The said order was not only passed in the presence of the respondent, but also in the presence of his Attorney, Rodrigues who was also a senior executive officer of the respondent. The relevant portion of that judgment is as under:-

""The claim put forth by Shrimati Maria Teresa de Sequeria from Panaji, in respect of Chalta No.14 of P.T. Sheet 65 was inquired into and it was found that the same belongs to the said Maria Teresa de Sequeria in view of Inventory Proceedings No.9- 1968 [1075-935] - vide Certificate issued by the Court of Civil Judge Senior Division, Panaji dated 27.5.72 and as such her title and possession to the Chalta No.14 of P.T. Sheet No.65 is confirmed.""
8. It may be pertinent to mention that the respondent had even participated in the said Court proceedings on behalf of his handicapped aunt, Edna May Sequeria as a guardian and received a cheque on her behalf. The appellant had deposited  Rs.40,000/-, the owelty money in the said Court proceedings which became payable on account of the purchase of the said house. The said suit property stood registered in Panaji Municipal Council in the name of the appellant. House tax was paid by the appellant to the Municipality on self-

9. The Panaji Municipal Council, Goa issued a certificate showing that possession of the suit premises was with the appellant and the house tax of the suit property was paid by her and she was the recorded owner of the same. According to the appellant, the respondent himself had acknowledged possession and title of the suit property in favour of the appellant.

10. The appellant submitted that she got married on 8.9.1974 to an Officer of the Indian Navy who was posted from time to time in different places in India. She also submitted that the respondent - her brother requested her that as his office is just adjacent to the suit property, therefore, it would  be convenient for him to run his office and to keep an eye on the suit property of the appellant. Therefore, the suit property was given to the respondent only as a caretaker.

11. The respondent executed a leave and licence agreement in the name of his wife to shift with his family out of the suit property completely on 1.4.1991 to Campo Verde Apartments at Caranzalem in Goa. The leave and licence agreement executed by the respondent's wife for the new house wherein the respondent and his family shifted on 1.4.1991 and thereafter got the agreement renewed on 7.3.1992. The respondent also owned one flat in Goa and occupied on 17.4.1991.

12. According to the appellant, the respondent handed over the suit property to his sister Maria in the first week of May, 1991 and requested her that some items which were already lying in the suit property which the respondent did not immediately require in his new place may be kept in the suit property. According to the appellant, her brother before shifting to the tenanted flat, handed over the keys of the house  to the appellant. The appellant did not take any receipt from her brother or click a photograph to create evidence showing handing over of the custodian possession of the suit property.

The respondent shifted to his new flat and the suit property was lying almost vacant because the appellant along with her husband was living outside Goa on his different official postings.

13. According to the appellant, the details of electricity, water and telephone bills clearly demonstrate that the house was locked and the small amounts payable in the said months, i.e., August, September, October and November in the year 1991, February 1992 also showed very nominal payments of Rs.30/-, Rs.33/-, Rs.68/- which conclusively proved that a house comprising of several rooms, drawing, dining, bathrooms, verandah, lawns etc. was lying vacant.

14. On 20.5.1992, the appellant returned with her family to Goa and occupied and enjoyed the said suit property. The appellant submitted that she has a valid title/ownership and was in possession of the suit property and she could not be  dispossessed by a Court in a suit for injunction. The appellant submitted that under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, the appellant could not have been legally compelled to hand over the possession to the respondent. It may be pertinent to mention that the respondent had filed a suit for injunction before the Trial Court. The Trial Court granted injunction in favour of the respondent and the same was upheld by the High Court in the impugned judgment in Civil Revision Application.

17. On 17.6.1992, the respondent filed a suit for permanent and mandatory injunction in the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division at Panaji as a Special Civil Suit No.131/92/A. On  22.6.1992, an ex-parte order for depositing the keys was passed while the appellant and her family members were living in the suit premises. The Trial Court decreed the suit.

22. The learned counsel for the parties reiterated the submissions made before the Courts below. The appellant submitted that she is a helpless and hapless sister of the respondent who has been kept out from her own house for more than two decades. The appellant is the owner of the suit property which is evident from the Certificate of the Probate Proceedings known as Inventory Proceeding No.1075/935.",Civil Case
"3. It is the case of the appellant-complainant, that the respondent-accused issued a cheque being Cheque No.034212 dated 4-3-2012 drawn on Axis Bank, Branch, Palwal in the name of the appellant towards repayment of a “friendly loan” of Rs.15 lakhs advanced by the appellant-complainant to the respondent- accused.

4. On 11-4-2012, the appellant-complainant deposited the said cheque in his bank, but the cheque was returned unpaid with the endorsement “Insufficient Fund”.

5. The appellant-complainant has alleged that, on the assurance of the respondent-accused, that there would be sufficient funds in his bank account to cover the amount of the cheque, the appellant-complainant again presented the cheque to his bank on 23-5-2012, but it was again returned unpaid with the remark “Insufficient Fund”.

6. On 15-6-2012, the appellant-complainant issued a legal notice to the respondent-accused through his lawyer, calling upon the respondent-accused to pay the cheque amount. The said notice, sent by registered post, was according to the appellant- complainant, duly served on the respondent-accused. The respondent-accused, however, did not reply to the notice. Nor did he pay the cheque amount to the appellant-complainant.
7. The appellant-complainant filed a Criminal Complaint against the respondent-accused, being Case No.106 of 2012 before the Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Palwal, under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

11. By a judgment and order dated 9-2-2015, the Judicial Magistrate I Class, Palwal convicted the respondent-accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year and further directed him to pay compensation of Rs.15 lakhs to the appellant-complainant within one month from the date of the said Judgment and order. Being aggrieved, the respondent-accused filed a criminal appeal No.13/2015 dated 9-3-2015 in the court of Additional Sessions Judge, Palwal.

12. By a judgment and order dated 20-2-2016, the Appellate Court upheld the conviction of the respondent-accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and confirmed the compensation of Rs.15 lakhs directed to be paid to the appellant- complainant. The sentence of imprisonment was however reduced to six months from one year.

13. The respondent-accused filed a Criminal Revision Petition being CRR No.849 of 2016 in the High Court challenging the Judgment and order of the Appellate Court. The appellant- complainant also filed a Criminal Revision Petition being CRR No.2017 of 2016 challenging the reduction of the sentence from one year to six months.

14. By a common final Judgment and order dated 21-11-2017 which is impugned before us, the High Court has reversed the concurrent factual findings of the Trial Court and the Appellate Court and acquitted the respondent of the charge under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, observing, inter alia, that there was fiduciary relationship between the appellant- complainant, an Income Tax practitioner, and the respondent- accused who was his client.

17. The Trial Court, on analysis of the evidence adduced by the respective parties arrived at the factual finding that the respondent-accused had duly issued the cheque in question for Rs.15 lakhs in favour of the appellant-complainant, in discharge of a debt or liability, the cheque was presented to the bank for payment within the period of its validity, but the cheque had been returned unpaid for want of sufficient funds in the account of the respondent-accused in the bank on which the cheque was drawn. Statutory Notice of dishonour was duly issued to which there was no response from the respondent-accused.

18. The Appellate Court affirmed the aforesaid factual findings. The Trial Court and the Appellate Court arrived at the specific concurrent factual finding that the cheque had admittedly been signed by the respondent-accused. The Trial Court and the Appellate Court rejected the plea of the respondent-accused that the appellant-complainant had misused a blank signed cheque made over by the respondent-accused to the appellant- complainant for deposit of Income Tax, in view of the admission of the respondent-accused that taxes were paid in cash for which the appellant-complainant used to take payment from the respondent in cash.",Criminal Case
"3. The facts as they emerge from the record fall within a very narrow compass. On 4th December, 2007, the Rajouri Garden Police Station received information that a woman had committed suicide at C-224, Tagore Garden Extension, Delhi. Upon making entry under DD No.16A of that date, Sub Inspector O.P. Mandal commenced investigation and reached the place of occurrence. The deceased was identified as Komal Kapoor. Her body was sent for post mortem. The Investigating Officer recorded the statement of her son Amit Kapoor and on 5.12.2007 at about 12.15 p.m. an FIR was registered on the complaint filed by him. This FIR was registered against Ramesh Chander Sibbal (the accused) and another, on the basis of the statement of Amit Kapoor and the suicide note. According to Amit Kapoor, he knew Ramesh Chander Sibbal for the last 10 years. Father of Amit Kapoor was running a paint brush business and had purchased property No.C-225, Tagore Garden, Delhi through the said Ramesh Chander Sibbal. Since the father of Amit Kapoor had fallen ill, his mother was also looking after the business. However, the family business suffered acute losses. The family discussed the possibility of selling their moveable and immoveable property situated at Rohini. The accused persons are stated to have fraudulently obtained signatures of the deceased in this connection. In order to get over the financial crises and to meet their liabilities, the deceased had also discussed the possibility of selling another plot owned by the family situated in Bawana Industrial Area. At that time also, the accused told the deceased that certain documents have to be executed before the plot is sold. On this pretext, he again got some papers signed by them. The accused paid a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- to the deceased at the first instance and thereafter a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- for the plot situated in Bawana as against the market value of Rs.28,00,000/-, with an assurance that the rest of the amount will be paid after execution of the sale deed.

4. Around the time of Dussehra in 2007, the accused approached the deceased claiming that he be given accommodation on a temporary basis for a period of ten to twelve days on the ground floor of her house situated at C- 224, Tagore Garden, Delhi on the pretext that his own house was under

renovation. The deceased believing him and keeping the relationship in mind, agreed and allowed him to occupy two rooms on the ground floor. It is alleged that while the deceased was away at Haridwar, just before the festival of Diwali, the accused encroached upon one more room in the said house. When the deceased asked the accused to vacate the said premises, he refused and, on the contrary, stated that he had paid a sum of Rs.24,00,000/- and that it was his house. Not only this, the accused as well as his son threatened the deceased and her family to vacate the house or else they would ruin them. It is also alleged that when the deceased asked the accused as to when she will get rid of this problem, he is said to have replied that she could get rid of this only after her death. This was followed by the accused sending a legal notice dated 1st December, 2007 to the deceased which was received on 3rd December, 2007 in which similar claim was made by the accused against the deceased. The trust that she had placed upon the accused was totally betrayed by him. This led to the deceased slipping into depression. In face of all these circumstances, coupled with the threats extended by the accused persons, the deceased committed suicide on 4.12.2007 at about 7.30 a.m. by hanging herself from a ceiling fan, using a scarf (chunni). It may be noticed at this stage, that the deceased had left a suicide note which can appropriately be reproduced at this stage as under :
“This Ramesh Sibbal, his wife Suman and his son Gaurav.
I am committing suicide for the reason that the aforesaid persons who are residing in our house forcefully, used to say that he was to do white wash so please allow him to keep some of his articles. But after some time, when I came, I saw that the aforesaid person has completely occupied my house as his own house. When my children objected to his aforesaid act, he said that he was to stay there only for a period of 04 days and that he would perform Diwali worship pooja ceremony at his own house but he did not vacate the house. When I had gone to Haridwar, he occupied front room of my house as well after giving beatings to my children. I know this person since that day when he had got my plot of Rohini disposed off. As we both (husband and wife) had not read those papers (relating to disposal of our Rohini plot) so this person kept on obtaining our signatures on the stamp papers relating to our House No. C-224 on the pretext that these papers were required to execute the lease. My husband was ill and I used to remain busy in looking after him.
5. The Investigating Officer prepared the site plan, effected recoveries of the articles from the place of occurrence and thereafter recorded the statements of the witnesses. Upon completion of the investigation, a charge sheet was filed in terms of Section 173(2) of the Code wherein Ramesh Chander Sibbal was stated as the accused and names of his wife, Suman Sibbal and son Gaurav Sibbal were shown in Column No.2. Upon committal, the learned Additional Sessions Judge framed charges against the accused under Sections 306 and 448 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC).",Civil Case
"3. The facts of the case are that the respondent/plaintiff filed a suit for eviction on the grounds of breach of terms of tenancy, damage to the property as well as causing nuisance and annoyance to the plaintiff and the other occupants. As per the plaintiff the original defendant was the tenant in respect of Room No.3 (hereinafter as suit premises) and was paying monthly rent of Rs.20/- including the water charges and excluding the electricity charges. The case of the plaintiff is that only the suit premises was let out though the original tenant was allowed to use a covered space of 10'x 4', but the same was for common usage and for access to W.C and water tap along with the other tenants.

4. Plaintiff claims that somewhere in January 2000, the defendant had requested the plaintiff to give keys of the two doors to clean the `Sherry' portion. But the said keys were not returned even after 2-3 days and the plaintiff became suspicious and requested the defendant for returning the keys, but in vain. Suspecting some foul play, the plaintiff entered the `sherry' to find that the defendant had placed his items over there and removed the drainage cover which was there in the Sherry. A police complaint was made with regard to the unauthorized possession but nothing happened. The plaintiff then requested the defendant to remove those articles but the request of the plaintiff was not heeded.

5. The defendant/appellant's father is said to have filed a suit for relief of declaration as tenant in the premises and to further restrain the landlord from interfering in the tenanted premises. In the said suit injunction was granted. Thereafter, the plaintiff had  demolished a wall that was there in the Sherry and put up a new door.

6. The original defendant expired during the pendency of the suit and his LRs were brought on record and they, in their written statement, admitted the relationship between the parties, but they denied all the allegations against them. They made a claim that the space measuring about 10'x4' abutting the entrance door of suit premises was in their exclusive use. As regards the suit filed by the appellant's father it was submitted that the same was settled outside the court with the understanding that the defendant would withdraw his suit, whereas the plaintiff will withdraw his suit simultaneously. An affidavit dated 16.03.01 was filed to that effect.

10. An appeal was filed against this order. The First Appellate Court vide its order dated 11.09.08 partly allowed the appeal. The trial Court's judgment was confirmed on the ground of causing waste and damage as contemplated under Section 16 (1) (a) of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, but the findings of the trial Court on the ground of nuisance and annoyance were set aside.

11. The Appellate Court noticed that in the suit filed by the defendants against the plaintiff, the defendants have specifically come out with the case that the dispute between the deceased defendant and the plaintiff with regard to the  alleged Sherry premises, was settled and an affidavit to this effect dated 16.03.01 was executed by the defendant. The Appellate Court thought it would be just and proper to take on record the certified copy of the order of dismissal of suit filed by the defendants dated 03.03.07 under provisions of Order 41 Rule 27

12. The Appellate Court placing reliance on para 10 of the affidavit of examination-in-chief of the defendants came to a conclusion that it was mentioned therein that the possession of the Sherry was with him and the said defendants handed over the possession to the plaintiff, as per affidavit dated 16.03.01. As such it was for the defendants to explain how they were occupying the said premises, to which there has been no reasonable explanation offered. It was concluded that the defendants had encroached upon the Sherry premises which was not let out to them and the said act definitely amounted to  causing waste and damage to plaintiff's property.

14. The appellants then moved to the High Court with a prayer to issue a writ of certiorari and/or any other writ, order or command and call for the papers and proceedings from the lower courts. The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition only on the ground that against concurrent finding of facts by the Courts below  the exercise of writ jurisdiction is not warranted.",Civil Case
"4. First, we shall take up the appeals in ITA Nos.2622/PUN/2016 to 2630/PUN/2016. However, in order to adjudicate the issues, reference is being made to the facts in ITA No.2622/PUN/2016, relating to assessment year 2009-

examination of the witness of the revenue i.e. parties from whom the purchases were made as well as the competent Sales Tax Authority on the basis of whose information the notice u/s. 148 of the Act was issued by the AO.

4. On the basis of facts and in the circumstances of the case and as per law, the Commissioner of Income Tax, (Appeals)-1, Nashik, is not justified in confirming the disallowance to the extent of 25% i.e. Rs.2,33,270/- of the purchases made from parties called as suspicious parties.

5. On the basis of facts and in the circumstances of the case and as per law, the Commissioner of Income Tax, (Appeals)-1, Nashik, is not justified in confirming the disallowance to the extent of 25% i.e. Rs.2,33,270/- of the purchases made from parties called as suspicious parties by holding that the said purchases are inflated particularly when the appellant has made the said purchases at prevailing market rate only.

7. Briefly, in the facts of the case, the assessee for the year under consideration had furnished return of income declaring total income of ₹ 10,22,560/- on 29.09.2009. Subsequently, information was received from the Director General of Income Tax (Investigation), Pune regarding beneficiaries in the hawala transactions detected by the Sales Tax Department of Maharashtra.
ITA Nos.2510 to 2512/PUN/2016 The information contained names, addresses and details of persons who had provided entries for bogus purchase bills and also contained the details of beneficiaries. Further, the persons who had provided entries to various beneficiaries had also filed affidavits (Notarized) before the Sales Tax Department stating that they had merely provided entries to those beneficiaries and no goods as indicated in those purported bills were supplied or delivered by them. The assessee was sole proprietor of M/s. A-One Tool, was one of the alleged beneficiaries in the said hawala transactions. The total amount mentioned in the bill was ₹ 9,33,075/-. On the basis of such information, the Assessing Officer issued notice under section 133(6) of the Act with the approval of CIT-1, Nashik to the assessee dated 06.06.2013 requesting the assessee to submit his explanation on the genuineness of said transactions. In response thereto, the assessee neither attended nor furnished any explanation. Further, another opportunity was given to the assessee and the assessee in the written submissions stated that purchases were duly recorded in the books of account and the payments were made through banking channels. The assessee also explained that material purchased was utilized in production of Tester. The Assessing Officer notes that the assessee failed to produce original bills or copies of purchases made from alleged parties for verification, transport and octroi receipts. The Assessing Officer thereafter, issued notice under section 148 of the Act and asked the assessee to file the return of income on or before 05.12.2013. The assessee neither attended nor furnished any return of income. Thereafter, notice under section 142(1) and 143(1) of the Act were issued to the assessee asking the assessee to explain as to why originally filed return of income should not be treated as filed in response to notice under section 148 of the Act. The assessee was also asked to furnish the details of purchases, sales, transport bills, octroi receipts, etc. The ITA Nos.2510 to 2512/PUN/2016 assessee in response stated that it had already filed the return of income on 26.12.2013 vide e-filing, which may be treated as return in response to notice issued under section 148 of the Act. The assessee also raised objections to re- assessment proceedings and issue of notice under section 148 of the Act, which were specifically redressed by the Assessing Officer. The Assessing Officer asked the assessee as to why purchases made from the alleged parties should not be added to the income of assessee. Vide para 8.1, the Assessing Officer also observes that vide office letter dated 23.12.2014, the assessee was asked to collect copies of statements recorded of hawala dealers during sales tax proceedings but the assessee failed to collect the same till date. The Assessing Officer was of the view that the assessee was not interested in collecting the said statements and then reference was made to different notices of hearing and the adjournment applications moved by the assessee. The Assessing Officer thereafter, issued notice under section 133(6) of the Act to verify the genuineness of purchases made by the assessee from the said parties. The said notices were returned unserved with postal remark 'Not Known' / Unclaimed. Under the said circumstances, the assessee was asked to produce alleged parties for verification along with copies of original bills, transport receipts, octroi receipts, etc. Another opportunity of hearing was given to the assessee in this regard. On a later date of hearing, copies of statements and affidavits filed by hawala dealers before the Sales Tax Authority were provided to the assessee and the case was fixed for hearing on 16.03.2015. However, the assessee did not appear before the Assessing Officer. The Assessing Officer noted that though the assessee had furnished details of cheque payments being made to the party but no other documents such as delivery challans, lorry receipts, transportation details, etc. were produced during the course of assessment proceedings and since the parties ITA Nos.2510 to 2512/PUN/2016 had admitted in front of the Sales Tax Department that they had not made any sales or purchase transactions. The said purchases were held to be bogus. Accordingly, addition of ₹ 9,33,075/- was made in the hands of assessee.",Administrative Case
"5. Reply has been filed by the official respondents, the private respondents as well as UPSC, who were issued notice subsequently during the pendency of the OA and given chance to file their reply.

7. In the year 2000-01, there occurred 2 vacancies in the grade of DDG (ISS). However, following the restructuring of DGS&D organization on recommendations of Group of Secretaries as well as ERC recommendations, a decision was taken to surrender the aforesaid 2 posts of DDG. Hence, no proposal for preparation of any panel for the said year was necessary.

8. In the year 2001-02, there occurred 1 vacancy in the grade of DDG (ISS) and 5 vacancies occurred in the year 2002-03, out of which only 4 were to be filled up in the grade of DDG (ISS) as 1 vacancy was utilized to accommodate repatriation of a Central Deputation, namely, Shri Om Prakash, DDG. Accordingly, proposal for preparation of panel for 4 vacancies for the year 2002-03 along with 1 vacancy for the year 2001-02 was forwarded to UPSC on 21.02.2002 with the recommendation that as per Recruitment Rules dated 23.9.1994, the selection for officers for promotion to the grade of Senior Administrative Grade (Deputy Director General) was required to be made on merit which meant those officers who were found to be outstanding were required to be placed above very good.

10. They have further submitted that even if DPC would have prepared separate panels for the years 2001-02 and 2002-03, applicant's name would not in any case have been considered for the vacancy of 2001-02 as his name did not figure in the zone of consideration. As per DPC recommendations and with the approval of the competent authority, the order appointing 3 Directors, namely, Shri R.P. Singh, Shri A.K. Saxena and Shri S. Farooq Hamid was issued on 12.8.2002 to the post of DDG keeping the panel still alive for the other 2 anticipated vacancies. In the year 2003-04, there were 4 anticipated vacancies for which a proposal was sent to UPSC on 3.1.2003 for preparation of a panel but before DPC could meet, the Government, on a fresh review following the process of restructuring of the organization of DGS&D, took a decision on 18.3.2003 not to abolish the said 2 posts of DDGs which fell vacant on 1.11.2000 and 1.1.2001, respectively as already mentioned above. It was proposed to fill up these 2 vacancies treating them as pertaining to the recruitment year 2002-03. The panel already prepared in respect of other vacancies pertaining to the year 2002-03 were let out of the purview of any review and DPC was proposed for a fresh panel of 2 officers for these 2 revived vacancies pertaining to 2003-04. Accordingly, DPC met in April, 2003 and recommended suitably. The DPC was again further reviewed. Based on the recommendations of the review DPC which met on 12.1.2004, only 4 vacancies pertaining to the recruitment year 2003-04 were filled up by promoting 4 ISS officers, including the applicant w.e.f. 20.5.2004. The appointment of all the above cited officers to the post of DDG (S) is further subject to outcome of CWP No. 4670/2000 filed by Shri G.V. Rajan and others before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi. They have thus submitted that applicant is already working as DDG (S) belonging to Senior Administrative Grade of Indian Supply Service (Group `A') in the Ministry of Defence w.e.f. 19.5.2004 and since DPC has a right to device his own procedure, it is not open to the court to interfere in this matter, therefore, the OA may be dismissed.",Administrative Case

"BHAGWATI, J. The petitioner is an organisation dedicated to the cause of release of bonded labourers in the country. The system of bonded labour has been prevalent in various parts of the country since long prior to the attainment of political freedom and it constitutes an ugly and shameful feature of our national life. This system based on exploitation by a few socially and economically powerful persons trading on the misery and suffering of large numbers of men and holding them in bondage is a relic of a feudal hierarchical society which hypocritically proclaims the divinity of men but treats large masses of people belonging to the lower rungs of the social ladder or economically impoverished segments of society as dirt and chattel. This system under which one person can be bonded to provide labour to another for years and years until an alleged debt is supposed to be wiped out which never seems to happen during the life time of the bonded labourer, is totally incompatible with the new egalitarian socioeconomic order which we have promised to build and it is not only an affront to basic human dignity but also constitutes gross and revolting violation of constitutional values. The appalling conditions in which bonded labourers live, not as humans but as serfs, recall to the mind the following lines from ""Man with the Hoe"" which almost seem to have been written with reference to this neglected and forlorn species of Indian humanity:

""Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground The emptiness of ages on his face, And on his back the burden of the world, They are non-beings, exiles of civilization, living a life worst than that of animals, for the animals are at least free to roam about as they like and they can plunder or grab food whenever they are hungry but these out castes of society are held in bondage, robbed of their freedom and they are consigned to an existence where they have to live either in hovels or under the open sky and be satisfied with whatever little unwholesome food they can manage to get inadequate though it be to fill their hungry stomachs. Not having any choice, they are driven by poverty and hunger into a life of bondage a dark bottomless pit from which, in a cruel exploitative society, they cannot hope to be rescued.
This pernicious practice of bonded labour existed in many States and obviously with the ushering in of independence it could not be allowed to continue to blight the national life any longer and hence, when we framed our Constitution, we enacted Article 23 of the Constitution which prohibits ""traffic in human beings and beggar and other similar forms of forced labour"" practised by any one. The system of bonded labour therefore stood prohibited by Article 23 and there could have been no more solemn and effective prohibition than the one enacted in the Constitution in Article 23. But, it appears that though the Constitution was enacted as far back as 26th January, 1950 and many years passed since then, no serious effort was made to give effect to Article 23 and to stamp out the shocking practice of to bonded labour. It was only in 1976 that Parliament enacted the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 providing for the abolition of bonded labour system with a view to preventing the economic and physical exploitation of the weaker sections of the people. But, unfortunately, as subsequent events have shown and that is borne out also by the Report made by the Centre for Rural Development Administration, Indian Institute of Public Administration to the Ministry of Labour Government of India on ""Rehabilitation of Bonded Labour in Monghyr District, Bihar"", the Report made by the Public Policy and Planning Division of the Indian Institute of Public Administration to the Ministry of Labour, Government of India on ""Evaluation Study of Bonded Labour Rehabilitation Scheme In Tehri Garhwal, U.P."", the Report of Laxmi Dhar Misra, the Director-General (Labour Welfare) of the Government of India based on On the Spot Studies Regarding Identification, Release of Bonded Labourers and Rehabilitation of Freed Labourers in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Orissa, Bihar, Rajasthan, Tamilnadu and Kerala and the Report of the National Seminar on ""Indentification and Rehabilitation of Bonded Labour"" held from 7th to 9th February, 1983 that the pernicious practice of bonded labour has not yet been totally eradicated from the national scene and that it continues to disfigure the social and economic life of the country at certain places. There are still a number of bonded labourers in various parts of the country and significantly, as pointed out in the Report of the National Seminar on ""Identification and Rehabilitation of Bonded Labour"" a large number of them belong to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes account for the next largest number while the few who are not from Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes are generally landless agricultural labourers. It is absolutely essential we would unhesitatingly declare that it is a constitutional imperative-that the bonded labourers must be identified and released from the shackles of bondage so that they can assimilate themselves in the main stream of civilised human society and realise the dignity, beauty and worth of human existence. The process of identification and release of bonded labourers is a process of discovery and transformation of non-beings into human-beings and what it involves is eloquently described in the beautiful lines of Rabindra Nath Tagore in ""Kadi and Komal""
The petitioner made a survey of some of the stone quarries in Faridabad district near the city of Delhi and found that there were a large number of labourers from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan who were working in these stone quarries under ""inhuman and intolerable conditions"" and many of whom were bonded labourers. The petitioner therefore addressed a letter to one of us on 25th February, 1982 pointing out that in the mines of Shri S.L. Sharma, Gurukula Indra Prastha, Post Amar Nagar, Faridabad, District, a large number of labourers were languishing under abject conditions of bondage for last about ten years, and the petitioner gave the names of 11 bonded labourers who were from village Asarha, Barmer district of Rajasthan, 7 bonded labourers who were from village Bharol, district Jhansi of Madhya Pradesh and 23 bonded labourers who were from village Barodia, Bhanger, Tehsil Khurai, district Sagar, M.P. The petitioner pointed out that there were ""yet another 14 bonded labourers from Lalitpur in U.P."". The petitioner also annexed to its letter, statements in original bearing the thumb marks or signatures as the case may be of these bonded labourers referred to in the letter. The petitioner pointed out in the letter that the labourers working in these stone quarries were living under the most inhuman conditions and their pitiable lot was described by the petitioner in the following words:

""Besides these cases of bonded labour, there are innumerable cases of fatal and serious injuries caused due to accidents' while working in the mines, while dynamiting the rocks or while crushing the stones. The stone-dust pollution near the stone crushers is so various that many a valuable lives are lost due to tuberculosis while others are reduced to mere skeletons because of T.B. and other diseases. The workers are not provided with any medical care, what to speak of compensating the poor worker for injury or for death. No cases are registered against the mine owners or the lessees for violation of safety rules under Mines Act. We are enclosing herewith the statements of about 75 workers who have suffered or are suffering continuously due to non-implementation of the rules by the Central Government or by Haryana Government or by the employers.
Almost 99% of the workers are migrant from drought prone areas of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra and Bihar. But if there is any one place where the Central legislation of Inter State Migrant Workmens Act 1979 is being most flagrantly violated it is here in these mines, without any residential accommodation, with the name-not even a thatched roof to fend against the icy winds and winter rain or against the scorching heat in midsummer, with scanty clothing, with very impure and polluted drinking water accumulated during rainy season in the clitches, with absolutely no facilities for schooling or childcare, braving all the hazards of nature and pollution and ill-treatment, these thousands of sons and daughters of Mother India epitomise the ""Wretched of the Earth"".
The letter dated 25th February 1982 addressed by the petitioner was treated as a writ petition and by an order dated 26th February 1982 this Court issued notice on the writ petition and appointed two advocates, namely, M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda as commissioners to visit the stone quarries of Shri S.L. Sharma in Godhokhor (Anangpur) and Lakkarpur in Faridabad district and to interview each of the persons whose names were mentioned in the letter of the petitioner as also a cross section of the other workers with a view to finding out whether they are willingly working in these stone quarries and also to inquire about the conditions in which they are working. M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda were directed to visit these stone, quarries on 27th and 28th February 1982 and to make a report to this Court on or before 2nd March 1982. Pursuant to this order made by us, M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda visited the stone quarries of S.L. Sharma in Godhokhor and Lakkarpur and carried out the assignment entrusted to them and submitted a report to this Court on 2nd March 1982. The Report pointed out inter alia that in the stone quarries of S.L. Sharma at Godhakhpur, ""many stone crushing machines were operating with the result that the whole atmosphere was full of dust and it was difficult even to breathe"". The report then referred to the statements of various workers interviewed by M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda and according to the statements given by some of them, namely, Lalu Ram, Dalla Ram, Thakur Lal, Budh Ram, Harda, Mahadev, Smt. Shibban, Hardev, Anam, Punnu, Ghanshyam, Randhir and Mute, they were not allowed to leave the stone quarries and were providing forced labour and they did not have even pure water to drink but were compelled in most cases to drink dirty water from a nallah and were living in Jhuggies with stones piled one upon the other as walls and straw covering at the top, which did not afford any protection against sun and rain and which were so low that a person could hardly stand inside them. The statements of these workers showed that a few of them were suffering from tuberculosis and even when injuries were caused due to accidents arising in the course of employment, no compensation was being paid to them and there were no facilities for medical treatment or schooling for children. The Report proceeded to state that M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda then visited mine no. 8 in Godhokhor stone quarries and here they found that the condition of the jhuggies was much worse in such as the jhuggies were made only of straw and most of the people living in jhuggies had no clothes to wear and were shivering from cold and even the small children were moving about without any proper clothing. M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda found that none of the inmates of the jhuggies had any blanket or woolen clothes and they did not even have any mat on which they could sleep. The statements of Phool Chand, Babu Lal, Bhoolu, Karaya, Ram Bahadur and Sallu also showed that all these workers were bonded labourers who were not allowed to leave the stone quarries and one of them, namely Sallu was seriously injured on his left leg only a day before the visit of M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda but be did not hope to get any compensation ""because here no one gets any compensation for any injury"". Most of the workers interviewed by M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda stated that they got very little by way of wages from the mine lessees or owners of stone crushers since they had to purchase explosives with their own moneys and they had to incur other expenses which, according to Dr. Patwardhan's report to which we shall refer hereafter, included 50 per cent of the expenses of drilling holes. M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda also pointed out in the Report that the following persons working in the Godhokhor stone quarries claimed that they were bonded labourers:

(1) Chand Bahadur son of Hastbir (2) Lal Bahadur son of Umbar Bahadur (3) Chhotey Lal son of Jarau (4) Harak Bahadur son of Jeet Bahadur (5) Gopal Bahadur son of Jhabu Singh (6) Roop Singh son of Govinda (7) Medh Bahadur son of Aspteir (8) Jiddey Bahadur son of Nunbahadur (9) Phool Bahadur son of Ram Bahadur (10) Heera Bahadur son of Balbahadur (11) Veer Bahadur son of Chhalvir (12) Nain Singh son of Lal Bahadur (13) Lal Bahadur son of Gang Bahadur (14) Ganesh son of Gang Bahadur (15) Amber Bahadur son of Sadhu Bahadur (16) Hira Lal son of Atbahadur (17) Kamar Bahadur (18) Jagadh Bahadur son of Top Bahadur (19) Gajender Bahadur son of Shyam Lal (20) Ganga Ram son of Lal Bahadur (21) Nar Bahadur and (22) Sant Bahadur son of Bhag Bahadur.
So far as the workers working in Lakkarpur stone quarries were concerned, the report of M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda stated that out of about 250 persons living in straw jhuggies 100 persons hailed from Bilaspur while 150 persons belonged to Allahabad and according to the report, 100 persons coming from Bilaspur stated that they were forcibly kept by the contractor and they were not allowed to move out of their place and they were bonded labourers. M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda described in the Report the pitiable condition in which these workers were living in straw jhuggies without any protection against sun and rain and with drinking water available only from the barsati nallah. The Report pointed out that wile M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda were interviewing the workers in the Lakkarpur stone quarry it started raining heavily and thereupon they took shelter in one of the jhuggies ""but inside the jhuggi it was not safe, as water was pouring inside"" and they were completely drenched inside the jhuggi. The Report also stated that, according to these workers, there were no medical facilities available and even where workers were injured they did not get any medical aid. The Report ended by cbserving that these workmen ""presented a picture of helplessness, poverty and extreme exploitation at the hands of moneyed people"" and they were found ""leading a most miserable life and perhaps beast and animal could be leading more comfortable life than these helpless labourers"".

Thereafter, the writ petition came up for hearing on 5th March 1982 along with another writ petition filed by the present petitioner for release of some other bonded labourers and on this day the Court made an order directing that the copies of the Report of M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda should be supplied to all the minelesses and stone crushers who are respondents to the writ petitions so that they may have an opportunity to file their reply to the facts found in the Report. The Court also appointed Dr. Patwardhan of Indian Institute of Technology to carry out a socio-legal investigation in the following terms:

""It is necessary that a socio-legal investigation should be carried out for the purpose of determining what are the conditions prevailing in the various quarries in Faridabad District and whether there are any workmen in those quarries against their will or without their consent and what are the conditions in which they are living and whether any of the provisions of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act and Inter- State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment & Conditions of Service) Act is being violated. We may make it clear that when we are directing a socio-legal investigation of these matters it is not in a spirit to criticise the State Government or any of its officers but with a view to find out the correctness of the state of affairs so that the State Government and its officers could take necessary steps for remedying the situation if a state of affairs exists which is contrary to the provisions of law and the basic human norms. The Court can take action only after the socio- legal investigation is carried out by some responsible person and a copy of the report of the socio-legal investigation is made available to the parties. We would, therefore, request Dr. Patwardhan of I.I.T. to be good enough to carry out a socio-legal investigation into the aforesaid matters in the quarries in Faridabad District a list of which will be supplied by Mr. Mukhoty on behalf of the petitioners to Dr. Patwardhan within' ten days from today after giving a copy to Mr. K.G. Bhagat, learned Counsel appearing for the State of Haryana. Dr. Patwardhan is requested to carry out socio-legal investigation with a view to putting forward a scheme for improving the living conditions for the workers working in the stone quarries and after the scheme is submitted to us we propose to hear the parties on the scheme with a view to evolving a final scheme with the assistance of the State of Haryana for the purpose of economic regeneration of these workmen. The Court permitted Dr. Patwardhan to take the assistance of any person other than the parties to the writ petition in order to help him in his task and at the suggestion of the Court, the State of Haryana agreed to deposit a sum of Rs. 1500 to meet the expenses of Dr. Patwardhan in carrying out the socio-legal investigation. The Court also recorded in its order that when it was pointed out in the Report of M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda that the workers in the stone quarries did not have any pure drinking water but were using dirty water from the nallah for drinking purposes, Mr. K.G. Bhagat learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the State of Haryana fairly stated that ""though it may not be strictly the obligation of the State Government, the State Government will take necessary measures for providing drinking facilities to the workmen in the stone quarries"". The Court also directed that the workmen whose names were set out in the writ petition and in the Report of M/s. Ashok Srivastava and Ashok Panda and particularly in regard to whom a separate statement had been filed in Court on behalf of the petitioner, would be free to go wherever they liked and they should not be restrained from doing so by any one and ""if they go to their respective villages, the district magistrates having jurisdiction over those villages"" shall ""take steps or measures to the extent possible for rehabilitating them.""",Constitutional Case

The notice stated in the clearest terms in paragraph (1) that ""Sealed tenders in the prescribed form are here by invited from Registered IInd Class Hoteliers having at least 5 years' experience for putting up and running a IInd Class Restaurant and two Snack bars at this Airport for a period of 3 years"". The latest point of time upto which the tenders could be submitted to the 1st respodent was stipulated in Paragraph 7 of the notice to be 12 p.m. On 25th January, 1977 and it was provided that the tenders would be opened on the same date at 12.30 hours. Paragraph (8) of the notice made it clear that ""the acceptance of the tender will rest with the Airport Director who does not bind himself to accept any tender and reserves to himself the right to reject all or ally of the tenders received without assigning any reasons therefore "" There were six tenders received by the 1st respondent in response to the notice and one of them was from the 4th respondents of offering a licence fee of Rs. 6666.66 per month, and the others were from Cafe Mahim, Central Catering Service, one A. S. Irani, Cafe Seaside and Care Excelsior offering progressively decreasing licence fee very much lower than that offered by the 4th respondents. The tenders were opened in the office of the Airport Director at 12.30 p.m. On 25th January, 1977 and at that time the 4th respondents were represented by their sole proprietor Kumaria. A. S. Irani was present on behalf of himself, Cafe Mahim, Cafe Seaside and Cafe Excelsior and there was one representative of Central Catering Service. The tenders of Cafe Mahim, Central Catering Service, Cafe Seaside and Cafe Excelsior were not complete since they were not accompanied by the respective income tax certificates, affidavits of immovable property and solvency certificates, as required by cl. (9) of the terms and conditions of the tender form. The tenders of A. S. Irani was also not complete as it was not accompanied by an affidavit of immovable property held by him and solvency certificates. The only tender which was complete and fully complied with the terms and conditions of the tender form was that of the 4th respondents and the offer contained in that tender was also the highest amongst all the tenders. Now it is necessary to point out at this stage that while submitting their tender the 4th respondents had pointed out in their letter dated 24th January, 1977 addressed to the Airport Director that they had 10 years' experience in catering to reputed commercial houses, training centres, banks and factories and that they were also doing considerable outdoor catering work for various institutions. This letter showed that the 4th respondents had experience only of running canteens and not restaurants and it appeared that they did not satisfy the description of ""registered IInd Class Hotelier having at least 5 years' experience"" as set out in paragraph (1) of the notice inviting tenders. The Airport officer, therefore, by his letter dated 15th February, 1977 requested the 4th respondents to inform by return of post whether they were a ""registered IInd Class Hotelier having at least 5 years experience"" and to produce documentary evidence in this respect within 7 days. The 4th respondents pointed out to the Airport officer by their letter dated 22nd February, 1977 that they had, in addition to what was set out in their earlier letter dated 24th January, 1977, experience of running canteens for Phillips India Ltd. and Indian oil Corporation and moreover, they held Eating House Licence granted by the Bombay Municipal Corporation since 1973 and had thus experience of 10 years in the catering line. It appears that before this letter of the 4th respondents could reach Airport officer, another letter dated 22nd February, 1977 was addressed by the Airport officer once again requesting the 4th respondents to produce documentary evidence to show if they were ''a registered Ilnd Class Hotelier having at least 5 years experience"". The 4th respondents thereupon addressed another letter dated 26th February, 1977 to the Director pointing out that they had considerable experience of catering for various reputed commercial houses, clubs, messes and banks and They also held an Eating House Catering Establishment (Canteen) Licence as also a licence issued under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. The 4th respondents stated that their sole proprietor Kumaria had started his career in catering line in the year 1962 at Hotel Janpath, Delhi and gradually risen to his present position and that he had accordingly ""experience equivalent to that of a IInd Class or even 1st Class hotelier."" This position was reiterated by the 4th respondents in a further letter dated 3rd March, 1977 addressed to the Director. This information given by the 4th respondents appeared to satisfy the 1st respondent and by a letter dated 19th April, 1977 the 1st respondent accepted the tender of the 4th respondents on the terms and conditions set out in that letter. The 4th respondents accepted these terms and conditions by their letter dated 23rd April, 1977 and deposited with the 1st respondent by was of security a sum of Rs. 39,999.96 in the form of fixed Deposit Receipts in favour of the Ist respondent and paid to the 1st respondent a sum of Rs. 6666.66 representing licence fee for one month and other amounts representing water, electricity and conservancy charges. The 4th respondents thereafter executed and handed over to the Ist respondent an agreement in the form attached to the tender on 1st May, 1977. The 4th respondents also got prepared furniture, counters and showcases as also uniforms for the staff, purchased inter alia deep freezers, water coolers, electrical appliances, icecream cabinets, espresso coffee machines, crockery, cutlery and other articles and things and also engaged the necessary staff for the purpose of running the restaurant and the two Snack bars But the Ist respondent could not hand over possession of the requisite sites to the 4th respondents, since A. S. Irani was running his restaurant and snack bars on these sites under a previous contract with the 1 st respondent and though that contract had come to an end, A. S. Irani did not deliver possession of these sites to the Ist respondent. The 4th respondents repeatedly requested the 1st respondent and the Airport Director who is the 2nd respondent in the appeal, to hand over possession of the sites and pointed out to the that the 4th repondents were incurring losses by reason of delay in delivery of possession, but on account of the intransigence of A. S. Irani the Ist respondent could not arrange to hand over possession of the sites to the 4th respondents.

Meanwhile one K. S, Irani who owned Cafe Excelsior filed Suit No. 6544 of 1977 in the City Civil Court, Bombay against the respondents challenging the decision of the Ist respondent to accept the tender of the 4th respondents and took out a notice of motion for restraining the 1 st respondent from taking any further steps pursuant to the acceptance of the tender. K. S. Irani obtained an ad- interim injunction against the respondents but after hearing the respondents, the City Civil Court vacated the ad-interim injunction and dismissed the notice of motion by an order dated 10th october, 1977. An appeal was preferred by K. S. Irani against this order, but the appeal was dismissed by the High Court on 19th october, 1977. Immediately thereafter, on the same day, the Ist respondent handed over possession of two, sites to the 4th respondents and the 4th respondents proceeded to set up snack bars on the two sites and started business of catering at the two snack bars. These two sites handed over to the 4th respondents were different from the sites occupied by A.S. Irani, because A. S. Irani refused to vacate the sites in his occupation. So far as the site for the restaurant was concerned, the Ist respondent could not hand over the possession of it to the 4th respondents presumably because there was no other appropriate site available other than the one occupied by A. S. Irani. Since A. S. lrani refused to hand over possession of the sites occupied by him to the Ist respondent, even though his contract had come to an end, and continued to carry on the business of running the restaurant and the snack bars on these sites, the Ist respondent was constrained to file suit No. 8032 of 1977 against A. S. Irani in the City Civil Court at Bombay and in that suit, an injunction was obtained by the 1st respondent restraining A. S. Irani from running or conducting the restaurant and the snack bars or from entering the premises save and except for winding up the restaurant and the snack bars. A. S. Irani preferred an appeal against the order granting the injunction, but the appeal was rejected and ultimately a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court was also turned down on 31st July, 1978.

This was, however, not to be the end of the travails of the 4th respondents. for, as soon as the appeal preferred by K. S. Irani against the order dismissing his notice of motion was rejected by the High Court on 19th October, 1977, A. S. Irani filed another suit being suit No. 8161 of 1977 in the City Civil Court, Bombay on 24th October,1977 seeking mandatory injunction for removal of the two snack bars put up by the 4th respondents. This was one more attempt by A. S. Irani to prevent the 4th respondents from obtaining the benefit of the contract awarded to them by the Ist respondent. He, however, did not succeed in obtaining ad- interim injunction and we are told that the notice of nation taken out by him is still pending in the City Civil Court.

It will thus be seen that A. S. Irani failed in his attempts to prevent the 4th respondents from obtaining the contract and enjoying its benefit. The 4th respondents put up two snack bars on the sites provided by the 1st respondent and started running the two snack bars from 1 9th october? 1977. The restaurant however, could not be put up on account of the inability of the Ist respondent to provide appropriate site to the 4th respondents and, therefore, the licence fee for the two snack bars had to be settled and it was fixed at Rs. 4.50O/- per month by mutual agreement between the parties. But it seems that the 4th respondents were not destined to be left in peace to run the two snack bars and soon after the dismissal of the appeal of A. S. Irani on l9th october, 1977 and the failure of A. S. Irani to obtain an ad interim mandatory injunction in the suit filed by him against the 1st and the 4th respondents, the appellant filed writ petition No. 1582 of 1977 in the High Court of Bombay challenging the decision of the 1st respondent to accept the tender of the 4th respondents. The writ petition was moved before a Single Judge of the High Court on 8th November, 1977 after giving prior notice to the respondent and after hearing the parties, the learned Single Judge summarily rejected the writ petition. The appellant preferred an appeal to the Division Bench of the High Court against the order rejecting the writ petition and on notice being issued by the Division Bench, the 1st and the 4th respondents filed their respective affidavits in reply showing cause against the admission of the appeal. The Division Bench after considering the affidavits and hearing the parties rejected the appeal in limine on 21st February, 1978. The appellant thereupon filed a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court and since it was felt that the questions raised in the appeal were of seminal importance, this Court granted special leave and decided to hear the appeal at an early date after giving a further opportunity to the parties to file their respective affidavits. That is how the appeal has now come before us for final hearing with full and adequate material placed before us on behalf of both the parties.

Now, on this view we should have ordinarily set aside the decision of the,- 1st respondent accepting the tender of the 4th respondents and the contract resulting from such acceptance but in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, we do not think it would be a sound exercise of discretion on our part to upset that decision and void the contract. It does appear from the affidavits filed by the parties that the appellant has no real interest in the result of the litigation, but has been put up by A. S. Irani for depriving the 4th respondents of the benefit of the contract secured by them. We find that a number of proceedings have been instituted for this purpose from time to time by A. S. Irani either personally or by instigating others to take such proceedings. The first salvo in the battle against the 4th respondents was fired by K. S. Irani, proprietor of Cafe Excelsior, who filed a suit challenging the decision of the 1st respondent to accept the tender of the 4th respondents, but in this suit he failed to obtain an interim injunction and his appeal was dismissed by the High Court on 19th October, 1977. It is significant that when the tenders were opened in the office of the Airport Director, Cafe Excelsior was represented by A. S. Irani, which shows that either Cafe Excelsior was a nominee of A. S. Irani or in any event K. S. Irani, proprietor of Cafe Excelsior, was closely connected with A. S. Irani. Moreover, it is interesting to note that though the tender of the 4th respondents was accepted as far back as 19th April, 1977, K. S. Irani did not adopt any proceedings immediately but filed the suit only after A. S. Irani was informed by the Airport Director on 22nd August, 1977 that a final order has been received from the Ministry requiring A. S. Irani to immediately close down his restaurant and snack bars. It is also a circumstance not without significance that A. S. Irani did not immediately take any proceeding for challenging the acceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents, but filed a suit in his own name only after the appeal of K. S. Irani was dismissed by the High Court on 19th October, 1977. These circumstances clearly indicate that the suit was filed by K. S. Irani at the instance of A. S. Irani or in any event in concert with him and when the suit of K. S. Irani failed to achieve the desired result, A. S. Irani stepped into the arena and filed his own suit. This suit was for a mandatory injunction seeking removal of the two snack bars which had in the meantime' been put up by the 4th respondents pursuant to the acceptance of their tender by the 1st respondent. But in this proceeding also A. S. Irani failed to obtain an ad- interim injunction. It was only after the failure to obtain interim relief in these two proceedings, one by K. S. Irani and the other by A. S. Irani, that the appellant filed the present writ petition in the High Court of Bombay challenging the decision of the 1st respondent to accept the tender of the 4th respondents. Now, it appears from the record that the appellant was at the material time conducting a restaurant called Royal Restaurant and Store which was owned in partnership by three persons, namely, J. K. Irani, K. M. Irani and G. S. Irani. G. S. Irani is the brother of A. S. Irani and he was managing and looking after the restaurant of A. S. Irani at the airport. It would, therefore, be a fair inference to make that the appellant was well connected with A. S. Irani and from the manner in which proceedings with a view to thwarting the attempt of the 4th respondents to obtain the benefit of their contract, have been adopted one after the other in different names, it does appear that the appellant has filed the writ petition at the instance of A. S. Irani with a view to helping him to obtain the contract for the restaurant and the snack bars. It is difficult to understand why the appellant should have waited until 8th November, 1977 to file the writ petition when the tender of the 4th respondents was accepted as far hack as 19th April, 1977. The explanation given by the appellant is that he was not aware of the acceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents but that is a rather naive explanation which cannot be easily accepted It is not possible to believe that the appellant who was so well connected with A. S. Irani and G. S. Irani did not know that A. S. Irani had failed to obtain the contract for running the restaurant and the snack bars and that this contract had been awarded to the 4th respondents as a result of which A. S. Irani was being pressed to close down his restaurant and snack bars. We have grave doubts whether this writ petition was commenced by the appellant bona fide with a view to protecting his own interest. Moreover, the writ petition was filed by the appellant more than five months after the acceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents and during this period, the 4th respondents incurred considerable expenditure aggregating to about Rs. 1,25,000/- in making arrangements for putting up the restaurant and the snack bars and in fact set up the snack bars and started running the same. It would now be most inequitous to set aside the contracts of the 4th respondents at the instance of the appellant. The position would have been different if the appellant had filed the writ petition immediately after the acceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents but the appellant allowed a period of over five months to elapse during which the 4th respondents altered their position. We are, therefore, of the view that this is not a fit case in which we should interfere and grant relief to the appellant in the exercise of our discretion under Article 136 read with Article 226 of the Constitution.",Constitutional Case
"ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petition No. XIII of 1950. Application under Art. 32 (1) of the Constitution of India for a writ of habeas corpus against the detention of the appellant in the Madras jail in pursuance of an order of detention made under the Preventive Detention Act, 1950. The material facts of the case and arguments of counsel are set out in detail in the judgments. The relevant provisions of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, are printed below.

(a) ""State Government"" means, in relation to a Part C State, the Chief Commissioner of the State; and

3. Power to make orders detaining certain persons.--(1) The Central Government or the State Government may---

(3) When any order is made under this section by a Dis- trict Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate or Commissioner of Police, he shall forthwith report the fact to the State Government to which he is subordinate together with the grounds on which the order has been made and such other particulars as in his opinion have a bearing on the necessi- ty for the order.

7. Grounds of order of detention to be disclosed to persons affected by the order.--(1) When a person is de- tained in pursuance of a detention order, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to him the grounds on which the order his been made, and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representa- tion against the order, in a case where such order has been made by the Central Government, to that Government, and in a case where it has been made by a State Government or an officer subordinate thereto, to the State Government.

Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose.

Most of the articles which are said to have been disre- garded occur under the heading ""Right to freedom,"" these articles being articles 19 (1) (d), 21 and 22. Another article which is also said to have been violated is article 32, under which the present application for a writ of habeas corpus purports to have been made.

A.K. Gopalan, the petitioner, who was already under the custody of the Superintendent, Central Jail, Cuddalore, was served with an order of detention under section 3 (1) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (Act IV of 1950) on the 27th February 1950. It was said in the order that the Governor of Madras was satisfied that it was necessary to make the order with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State and the maintenance of public order. On 20th March 1950 a petition was presented to this Court under article 32 of the Constitution praying for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus directing the State of Madras to produce him before the Court and to set him at liberty. A writ was accordingly issued. The return to the writ is that the detention is legal under Act IV of 1950, enacted by Parlia- ment. The petitioner contends that the Act abridges and infringes certain provisions of Part III of the Constitution and is thus outside the constitutional limits of the legis- lature and therefore void and unenforceable. The matter is one of great importance both be-cause the legislative power expressly conferred by the 7th Schedule has been impugned and because the liberty of the citizen is seriously affected. The decision of the question whether Act IV of 1950 takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution depends on a consideration of two points:

(1) In what measure has the Constitution secured person- al liberty to a citizen of India, and.
(2) has the impugned legislation in any way taken away or abridged the rights so secured and if so, to what extent ?
The petitioner, it is said, was initially arrested in Malabar on 17th of December, 1947, and prosecution was started against him on various charges for having delivered certain violent speeches. While these criminal cases were going on, he was served with an order of deten- tion under the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act on 22nd April, 1948. This order of detention was held to be illegal by the Madras High Court, but on the same day that the judgment was pronounced, a second order of detention was served upon him. On his moving the High Court again for a writ of habeas corpus in respect to the subsequent order, his application was dismissed on the ground that as he was not granted bail in one of the three criminal cases that were pending against him, the detention could not be said to be unlawful. Liberty, however, was given to him to renew his application if and when his detention under the criminal proceedings ceased. In two out of the three criminal cases the trial before the magistrate ended on February 23, 1949, and the petitioner was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 6 months in each of the cases. These sentences, however, were set aside in appeal on 26th September, 1949. As re- gards the third case, he was tried by the Sessions Judge of North Malabar and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 5 years but this sentence was reduced to 6 months' imprison- ment by the Madras High Court on appeal. The petitioner made a fresh application to the High Court praying for a writ of habeas corpus in respect of his detention under the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act and this application, which was heard after he had served out his sentences of imprisonment referred to above, was dismissed in January, 1950. On 25th February, 1950, the Preventive Detention Act was passed by the Parliament and on the 1st of March follow- ing, the the detention of the applicant under the Madras Maintainance of Public Order Act was cancelled and he was served with a fresh order of detention under section 3 (1) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950. On behalf of the respondents the detention of the petitioner is sought to be justified on the strength of the Preventive Detention Act of 1950. The position taken up on behalf of the petitioner on the other hand is that the said Act is invalid and ultra vires the conStitution by reason of its being in conflict with certain fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the Constitution. It is argued, therefore, that the detention of the peti- tioner is invalid and that he should be set at liberty. The contentions that have been but forward-by Mr. Nambi- ar who appeared in support of the petition, may be classi- fied under four heads. His first contention is that as preventive detention is, in substance, a restriction on the free movements of a person throughout the Indian territory, it comes within the purview of article 19 (1) (d) of Part III of the Constitution which lays down the fundamental rights. Under clause (5) of the article, any restriction imposed upon this right of free movement must be reasonable and should be prescribed in the interests of the general public. The question as to whether it is reasonable or not is a justiciable matter which is to be determined by the Court. This being the legal position, the learned Counsel invites us to hold that the main provisions of the impugned Act, particularly those which are contained in sections 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are wholly unreasonable and should be invalidated on that ground.",Constitutional Case

"The Court further held that the substance of the protection provided by rules like R. 55 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules promulgated on May 27, 1930 under S.96-B of the Government of India Act, 1915 (sic), was bodily lifted out of the said Rules and together with an additional opportunity embodied in 5. 240(3) of the GOI Act was incorporated in Art. 311(2) S0 as to convert the protection into a constitutional safeguard. The Court also held that the opportunity to show cause against the penalty proposed should be given after a stage has been reached where the charges had been established and the competent authority had applied its mind to the gravity or otherwise of the proved charges tentatively and proposed a particular punishment. It was necessary to state so, since in that case no notice was served upon the appellant there when the competent authority accepted the report of the Inquiry Officer and confirmed the opinion that the punishment of dismissal should be inflicted on him, and no cause, therefore, could be shown by him. On the other hand, by the first notice itself which communicated the charges, the appellant was called upon to show cause as to why he should not be dismissed from service, although the notice further called upon the appellant to state in reply whether he wished to be heard in person and whether he would produce his defence.

10. The respondent B. Karunakar in the. main appeal while working as a Sr. Technical Officer, was served on December 27, 1986 with a Memorandum of Charges setting out the misconduct, said to have been committed by him, with details thereof that he had unauthorisedly sold T.V. sets. The enquiry officer appointed in this behalf conducted the enquiry, recorded the evidence, given him adequate opportunity to rebut the evidence. On March 13, 1987 the enquiry officer submitted his report finding that the respondent acted fraudulently and dishonestly in conducting the business of the appellant company and acted thereby prejudicially to the interest of the company. On its consideration and agreeing with the findings, the disciplinary authority, by proceedings dated April 27, 1987, removed him from service and on appeal it was confirmed. The single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dismissed his writ petition but on appeal, the Division Bench, by judgment dated March 29, 1991 relying on the Union of India v. Mohd. Ramzan Khan, (1991) 1 SCC 588 : (AIR 1991 SC 471), allowed it. In this case the rules framed by the company does not require the supply of the copy of the report to the delinquent. In Civil Appeal No. 4148/91 Union of India v. A. J. Shah, the respondent, while working as T.T.E. in S. E. Railway, was found to have collected excess amounts from the passengers. Enquiry Officer, after giving an opportunity to the respondent, submitted his report and the disciplinary authority agreeing with the findings of guilt recorded by the enquiry officer, reverted him to the grade of Ticket Collector in the pay scale of Rs. 950-1500 fixing his initial pay as Rs. 950/-. The CAT at Cuttack set it aside as the enquiry report was not supplied to him holding that it resulted in denial of opportunity and violates the principles of natural justice. In Civil Appeal No. of 1993 (arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 13813 of 1992) State of M.P. v. A. Sheshagiri Rao, the respondent, while working as Executive Engineer, was suspended by order dated 21st July, 1983. On October 21, 1983 he was served with a charge-sheet. After conducting an enquiry the enquiry officer submitted his report and the disciplinary authority while agreeing with the findings of guilt, reverted him by an order dated October21, 1987 as an Asstt. Engineer. It was set aside by the Tribunal, holding that non-supply of the enquiry report was denial of opportunity under Art. 311(2) and it violates the principle of natural justice. In C.A. No. of 1993 (arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 17484 of 1991) Union of India v. Mohammed Naimulla, the respondent was working as an electrical fitter. On March 11, 1983 a charge- sheet was issued. The enquiry officer had given him reasonable opportunity and after completing the enquiry submitted his report that the charges were proved against the respondent. The disciplinary authority by an order dated April 29, 1988 removed him from service. On appeal, it was confirmed. The Tribunal set aside the order. In all these cases the enquiry report was not supplied. In C.A. No. 302 of 1992, Bank of India v. Vinodchandra Balkrishan Pandit, the respondent was served with a charge-sheet on 10th August, 1982 accusing him of having committed misconduct by taking illegal gratification in his discharge of official duties. The enquiry officer after giving full opportunity found him to have received illegal gratification in the stated instances and was guilty of the charges. The disciplinary authority agreed with the findings of the enquiry officer; removed him from service by supplying him a copy of the enquiry report along with the order of removal as required under Regulation 9 of the Bank of India Employees (Disciplinary Appeal) Regulations, 1976.

2. The applicant, while working as Assistant Station Master at Shankarapalli Railway Station in Secunderabad Division of South Central Railway, was issued with a major penalty charge Memorandum dated 31.10.1981 and he was kept under suspension from 10.4.1981 to 23.8.1990. The impugned actions of the Respondents against the applicant in relation to the said suspension and the disciplinary proceedings have been examined by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad Bench culminating in treating the penalty finally imposed on the applicant as a minor penalty, resulting in regularisation of suspension period.

The 3rd respondent, vide Memorandum dated 28.9.2005 and 22.6.2006 treated the period of suspension as on duty and promoted the applicant to the scale of Rs.455-700 (Rs.1400-2300/Rs.5000-8000) on proforma basis with effect from 1.8.1982 and on actual basis with effect from 1.8.1983 i.e., the date of promotion of his junior, by mentioning that the applicant was eligible for consequential benefits as per rules. The said Memos were issued after the applicant retired from service in Vijayawada Division.
4. Consequent on issue of the Memos dated 23.2.2006 and 22.6.2006 issued by the 3rd respondent, the 4th respondent had issued the impugned pay fixation Memorandum dated 19.10.2006 fixing the pay of the applicant in grade Rs.1400-2300/Rs.5000-8000 which were equivalent to the grade Rs.455-700.
5. The applicant was transferred on administrative grounds from Secunderabad Division to Vijayawada Division along with the post and joined Vijayawada Division on 1.8.1990 in grade Rs.455-700 (Rs.1400-2300).
6. The applicant, while working as Station Master in South Central Railway, retired from service on 31.5.2000 on attaining the age of superannuation.
7. The 5th respondent issued the Pension Payment Order on 31.5.2000 fixing the basic pension of the applicant as Rs.2053/- with effect from 1.6.2000. The said pension was revised on 10.2.2004 as Rs.3325/- with effect from 1.6.2000 consequent on revision of last pay and qualifying service by treating the suspension period as duty. Further, in terms of letter dated 30-.11.2006, the 5th respondent had revised the pension of the applicant from Rs.3325/- to Rs.3475/-
with effect from 11.2.2004 as a sequel to revision of last pay/qualifying service. The applicant has submitted that the above fixation, which needs to be further revised w.e.f. 1.6.2000 after affording due promotions to the applicant to grade Rs.5500-9000 and Rs.6500-10500 with reference to his position in grade Rs.455-700 as on 1.8.1982, has not been done by the 4th and 5th respondents.

8. Since the seniority of the applicant was not fixed in grade Rs.455-700/1400-2300 in Vijayawada Division while the said grade/seniority was allowed in Secunderabad Division, the applicant made representation dated 1.11.2006 to the 2nd respondent requesting to re-fix his seniority and pay in Vijayawada Division. The applicant has submitted that there was no response to the said representation. He filed O.A.No.337/2007 seeking a direction to fix his pay in the higher grades after extending the benefit of promotion to the grades of Rs.5500/9000 RS(RP) and Rs.6500-10500, and accordingly allow pensionary benefits and to pay interest @ 18% p.a. on all the arrears. The Tribunal disposed of the said OA vide Order dated 8.2.2008, inter alia, with a direction to the applicant to submit a representation.

9. The applicant had submitted representation dated 2.4.2008 mentioning the Office Order NO.B.P.524/VI/OAs/Retired ASMs, dated 5.12.1997 wherein the relief prayed for by the applicant in O.A.No.337/2007 was already granted to certain other similarly situated employees whose cases were similar to the applicant herein. Thereafter, vide the impugned order dated 28.5.2008, the 4th respondent rejected the claim of the applicant stating that the three cases figured in the Office Memorandum dated 5.12.97 are not similar to that of the applicant as the three employees in whose case benefits were extended though were taken up with major penalty proceedings, the said proceedings were dropped, whereas the applicant was inflicted with a minor penalty. Hence the present OA has been filed seeking for the following reliefs:-

To call for the records pertaining to the Senior Divisional Personnel Officer, Vijayawada Memorandum No.B/P.524/VI/1/OA/01/KPC daed 19.10.2006 and the Senior Divisional Personnel Officer, Vijayawada Memorandum No.B/P.524/VI/1/OA No.337/07/KPC dated 28.5.2008 and to declare the actions of the respondents in not extending the benefit of promotion to the applicant to the grades Rs.5500-9000 and Rs.6500-10500 as illegal, arbitrary and unjust and contrary to the direction of this Tribunal in O.A.NO.1467/2001 and violative of Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the constitution and consequently direct the respondents to provide promotion to the applicant in the grades Rs.5500-9000 and Rs.6500-10500 from the date the juniors to the applicant were promoted, fix the pay of the applicant, accordingly allow pensionary benefits, pay arrears of pay and pensionary benefits and to pay interest of 18% per annum on all the arrears and pass such other order or orders as deemed fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice.
11. The applicant has further argued that the Respondents 4 and 5, having implemented the order of the Tribunal, ought to have extended all the benefits, which are consequential in nature and accordingly the 5th respondent, by fixing his pay in the grade of Rs.6500-10500 ought to have revised the Pension Payment Order for allowing the due pension.

14. The applicant has further submitted that the 4th respondent had not assigned the seniority to the applicant in grade Rs.455-700 even though the applicant had been promoted to the said grade by the 2nd respondent with effect from 1.8.1982. However, as seen from the seniority lists dated 24.2.1996 and 2.2.2000 published by the 4th respondent for grade Rs.1600-2660 (Rs.5500-9000) and Rs.6500-10500, juniors to the applicant were promoted to those grades with effect from 1.3.1993 and 22.5.1997 respectively.

17. The applicant has further argued that it is an admitted fact that by virtue of a direction of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Ernakulam Bench, in O.ANo.1301 of 1995, proforma promotion was extended to one Shri P.P.Chandrasekharan and by virtue of the direction of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad Bench in O.A.Nos.1174 of 1997 and 1180 of 1997, the representations submitted by Shri Raghava Chetty and Shri Kamaraju were disposed of by the respondents, duly considering their cases also on the lines of Shri P.P.Chandrasekharan and accordingly promotions were granted to the higher grades on par with their juniors. The applicant has submitted that the said three employees were extended with the benefits of promotions to the higher grades after their retirement only without subjecting them for either suitability/selection and the said three employees were also issued with major penalty proceedings on the allegations similar to the one levelled against the applicant herein. However, the Disciplinary Authorities were different in all these cases.

18. The applicant has argued that while the cases of the above said three employees resulted in exoneration of the charges, the case of the present applicant ended up in infliction of a minor penalty. It is submitted that whether there was exoneration or infliction of minor penalty, all the four employees including the present applicant stands under the extant rules on the same footing for the benefit of promotion to the higher grade. The applicant states that the respondents are not correct in showing discrimination to the applicant on the sole ground that he was inflicted with a minor penalty, which penalty was of no significance to reckon with for denying the benefit of proforma promotion on par with juniors. In all the said three case also, the benefit of promotion was extended on proforma basis based on the directions of the Tribunal, whereas in the case of the applicant the respondents are taking a different stand in spite of the Tribunal's direction to examine his case in the light of the office Order dated 5.12.1997.",Administrative Case
"2. After taking cognizance of the fact that large number of ad hoc appointments were being made in different departments without complying with the relevant rules and procedure, the Government of Bihar vide its Circular No.7260 dated 27.4.1979 which was followed by another Circular No.3001 dated 16.3.1982 imposed ban on such appointments. Notwithstanding this, ad hoc appointments continued to be made in violation of the rules and relevant instructions. This compelled the State Government to pass order dated 10.3.1985 for cancellation of ad hoc appointments and for filling the vacancies in accordance with the rules. After one year, the issue relating to large scale illegalities committed in the making of ad hoc appointments was raised in the Bihar Legislative Assembly and members expressed concern over such appointments. In the backdrop of this development, Chief Secretary, Government of Bihar vide his letter dated 11.6.1986 made it clear to all the Secretaries to the Government, Heads of Departments, Divisional Commissioners and District Magistrates that they will be personally responsible for the compliance of the rules and instructions in the making of ad hoc appointments. It, however, appears that the ban imposed by the State Government was relaxed qua Animal Husbandry Department and vide letter dated 4.7.1987, Under Secretary to the Government informed the Director, Animal Husbandry that for implementation of the schemes being operated by the department, appointments may be made on Class IV posts by committees comprising of Regional Director, Animal Husbandry as Chairman, Regional Joint Director, Animal Husbandry/Assistant Director, Animal Husbandry as Secretary and one officer belonging to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes.

35. The facts of Jagjit Singh's case were that the respondents who had given the highest bid for 338 square yards plot in Sector 31A, Chandigarh defaulted in paying the price in accordance with the terms and conditions of allotment. After giving him opportunity of showing cause, the Estate Officer cancelled the lease of the plot. The appeal and the revision filed by him were dismissed by the Chief Administrator and Chief Commissioner, Chandigarh respectively. Thereafter, the respondent applied for refund of the amount deposited by him. His request was accepted and the entire amount paid by him was refunded. He then filed a petition for review of the order passed by the Chief Commissioner, which was dismissed. However, the officer concerned entertained the second review and directed that the plot be restored to the respondent. The latter did not avail benefit of this unusual order and started litigation by filing writ petition in the High Court, which was dismissed on March 18, 1991. Thereafter, the respondent again approached the Estate Officer with the request to settle his case in accordance with the policy of the Government to restore the plots to the defaulters by charging forfeiture amount of 5%. His request was rejected by the Estate Officer. He then filed another writ petition before the High Court which was allowed only on the ground that in another case pertaining to Smt. Prakash Rani, Administrator had restored the plot even after her writ petition was dismissed by the High Court. While reversing the order of the High Court, this Court observed:",Constitutional Case
"2. The applicant joined the respondent organization on 9.12.1954. He retired from service on attaining the age of 58 years on 30.6.1988 while he was in the post of Scientist 'D' category. By the Office Memorandum No. 7 (3)/85-D (R & D) dated 24.12.1985 the superannuation of Scientist and Technical Personnel (Gazetted) was enhanced from 58 to 60years. But there was a proviso to the effect that the said enhancement was applicable only to those people who had been promoted to the grades they were holding at the time of attaining the age of 58 years within the preceding 5 years.

3. The said proviso was challenged by one Sri O.P. Gupta and few others before the Central Administrative Tribunal and the Tribunal had quashed the same. That order was upheld by the Apex Court in Civil Appeal No. 1488 of 1990. On the basis of the said judgment 12 retired persons in the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO for short) were reinstated in service for the remaining part of the age and they were paid full allowances. The applicant filed representation dated 13.5.1998 requesting to extend the same benefit to him also, but the respondent by letter dated 15.6.1998 has not accepted the said request stating that the benefit has to be extended only to those applicants. As the present applicant is not a party to the case he was not entitled the benefit. Hence this application.

9. The fact that the applicant was working with the respondent and he retired on attaining the age of 58 years on 30.6.1988 while working in the post of Scientist D category is not in dispute. Actually there is no dispute in the facts asserted by the applicant regarding the service particulars of the applicant. The judgments of the Apex Court in O.P. Gupta is filed by the applicant as Annexure A, 3 at page 10 of the application. It is to be seen from this that not only the case of O.P. Gupta but the following are also disposed of :-

""Civil Appeal Nos. 76 of 1992 and 2498-99 of 1992 and Civil Appeal No. 14750 of 1996 (arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 4528 of 1993). It is stated in this order, ""As the common question is involved for decision in all these appeals, common order is passed.""",Administrative Case
"2. The OA is filed being aggrieved by the notification dated 05.03.2015 in regard to the allocation of the applicant to the IPS cadre to the residuary State of Andhra Pradesh.

3. The brief facts of the case are that the applicant belongs to the 1993 batch Indian Police Service (hereinafter referred as IPS). He was allotted to the composite State of Andhra Pradesh under the outsider category (UR) as per Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954. Due to bifurcation of the composite State of Andhra Pradesh into the Residual State of Andhra Pradesh and the State of Telangana, the applicant has been allotted to the IPS Cadre of residuary State of Andhra Pradesh. Aggrieved over the same, the OA is filed.

4. The contentions of the applicant are that the Pratyush Sinha Committee formed under Section 80(i) of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014 (hereinafter referred as 2014 Act) has not acted as per the letter and spirit of the said Act. In particular, the applicant states that the Committee has not followed the terms of reference made to it by the Central Government. The applicant claims that there was neither any transparency nor any objectivity in determination of cadre strength.

No reasonable opportunity was given to any of the members to raise any objections to the guidelines formulated for the distribution of officers. The Committee had to favour a few members of the services and therefore the allotment list was prepared before finalising the formal guidelines. The Members of the Committee had conflicting interests and therefore the recommendations of the Committee are vitiated. The draw of lot is in favour of Telangana and instead of doing so, the respondents later communicated that the draw of lots was for drawing of roster and not for starting the allocation. The logic for starting the allocation from the State of Andhra Pradesh has not been explained. The representations made have not been responded to. There is no fair and equitable distribution as required under Section 80 of Act, 2014. The swapping policy has been found to be biased by bringing in discrimination between direct recruitee insider and direct recruitee outsider. There is total lack of application of mind in arriving at the decision of swapping opportunity given with different criteria for different classification. Arbitrary swapping was done for few officers by respondent No.1 in an opaque, discriminatory and biased manner. Swapping has been confined for direct recruitee outsider(UR) group in a batch and the same was not applied in case with the promotion quota/DR insider. As per All India Services Act, 1951 and rules made thereunder, once the cadre is allotted to any particular state, the classification of insider and outsider does not exist for future promotions etc. An identical issue of some IAS and IPS officers in regard to the cadre allocation when challenged before the Tribunal, the said cases were allowed by this Tribunal on 29.03.2016. The case of the applicant is fully covered by the said judgment and hence, he is seeking similar relief.

40. If persons recruited from different sources are integrated into one class, they cannot thereafter be classified so as to permit in favour of some of them a preferential treatment in relation to others. That is the argument before us which, applied to be facts of the case, means in plain terms this: Direct recruits and promotees having been appointed as Assistant Engineers on equal terms, they constitute an integrated class and for purposes of promotion they cannot be classified on the basis of educational qualifications.",Administrative Case
"3. Jai Bhagwan Sharma, proprietor of M/s. Sharma Carpets, the respondent herein, deals in carpets. Rajinder Kumar, proprietor of M/s. Kumar Exports, the appellant herein, is carrying on business at Panipat. It is the case of the respondent that the appellant purchased handtufted woolen carpets from him on August 6, 1994, cost of which was Rs.1,90,348.39. According to the respondent, the appellant issued two cheques, i.e., one cheque bearing No. 052912 dated August 25, 1994 for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- and another cheque bearing No. 052913 dated September 25, 1994 for an amount of Rs.90,348.39 drawn on Panipat branch of Union Bank of India, for discharge of his liability. The case of the respondent is that the cheques were deposited in the bank by him for encashment, but those cheques were received back unpaid with remarks ""insufficient funds"". It is the case of the respondent that the fact that the cheques were dishonoured for insufficient funds was brought to the notice of the appellant and on the request of the appellant, the cheques were again presented for encashment in the bank on January 5, 1995, but they were again dishonoured due to lack of funds in the account of the firm of the appellant. What is claimed by the respondent is that under the circumstances he had served statutory notice dated January 19, 1995 calling upon the appellant to make payment of the amount due but neither the appellant had replied the said notice nor made payment of the amount due. The respondent, therefore, filed Criminal Complaint No. 178 of 2001 in the court of the learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Karnal and prayed to convict the appellant under Section 138 of the Act.

4. On service of summons the appellant appeared before the Court. His defence was that the bill produced by the respondent indicating sale of woolen carpets was a fictitious one and that blank cheques with his signatures were taken from him by the respondent to enable the respondent to purchase the raw material for him. According to the appellant the cheques were in the form of advance payment for supply of carpets, but the respondent had failed to deliver the goods to him. The appellant alleged that the respondent had stopped manufacturing carpets and as the cheques were not issued in discharge of any liability, he was not liable to be convicted under Section 138 of the Act.

5. In order to prove his case the respondent examined himself as CW-3 and produced the cheques dishonoured at Ex. CW-2/A and CW-2/B, statutory notice at Ex. C-4, carbon copy of bill at CW-2/C, etc. He examined two witnesses to prove the presentation and dishonour of the cheques. No other witness was examined by him in support of his case pleaded in the complaint against the appellant. The appellant examined himself to substantiate his defence as DW-1. He also examined one Mr. Om Prakash, serving as a clerk in the Sales Tax Department, as DW-2, who stated before the Court that the respondent's firm had filed sales tax return for the Assessment Year 1994-95 declaring that no sale or purchase of woolen carpets had taken place and, therefore, no sales tax was deposited. The said witness also produced an affidavit filed by the respondent as Ex.D-1 wherein the respondent had stated on oath that no sale or purchase of woolen carpets had taken place during the Assessment Year 1994-95.",Criminal Case
"4. It is contended that the existence of a woman in such an atmosphere is entirely dependent on the male view of the reputation of the family, the community and the milieu. Sometimes, it is centered on inherited local ethos which is rationally not discernible. The action of a woman or a man in choosing a life partner according to her or his own choice beyond the community norms is regarded as dishonour which, in the ultimate eventuate, innocently invites death at the cruel hands of the community prescription. The reputation of a woman is weighed according to the manner in which she conducts herself, and the family to which the girl or the woman belongs is put to pressure as a consequence of which the members of the family, on certain occasions, become silent spectators to the treatment meted out or sometimes become active participants forming a part of the group either due to determined behaviour or unwanted sense of redemption of family pride.

It has been contended by the State of Madhya Pradesh that the State Government and the police are alive to the problem of honour killings and they have created a ""Crime Against Women Cell"" at the State level headed by the Inspector General of Police to ensure safety of couples and active prosecution in each case of honour killing.

"49. The Petitioner is the holder of the passport issued to her on 1st June, 1976 under the Passport Act, 1967. On 4th My, 1977 the Petitioner received a letter dated 2nd July, 1977 from the Regional Passport Officer, Delhi intimating to her that it has been decided by the Government of India to impound her passport under Section 10(3)(c) of the Act in public interest and requiring her to surrender the passport within seven days from the date of receipt of the letter. The petitioner immediately addressed a letter to the Regional Passport Officer requesting him to furnish a copy of the statement of reasons for making the order as provided in Section 10(5) to which a reply was sent by the Government of India, Ministry of External Affairs on 6th July, 1977 stating inter alia that the Government has decided ""in the interest of the general public"" not to furnish her a copy of the statement of reasons for making of the order.' The Petitioner thereupon filed the present petition challenging the action of the Government in impounding her passport and declining to give reasons for doing so. The action of the Government was impugned inter alia on the ground that it was mala fide, but this challenge was not pressed before us at the time of the hearing of the arguments and hence it is not necessary to state any facts bearing on that question. The principal challenge set out in the petition against the legality of the action of the Government was based mainly on the ground that Section 10(3)(c), in so far as it empowers the Passport Authority to impound a passport ""in the interests of the general public"" is violative of the equality clause contained in Article 14 of the Constitution, since the condition denoted by the words ""in the interests of the general public"" limiting the exercise of the power is vague and undefined and the power conferred by this provision is, therefore, excessive and suffers from the vice of ""over-breath."" The petition also contained a challenge that an order under Section 10(3)(c) impounding a passport could not be made by the Passport Authority without giving an opportunity to the holder of the passport to be heard in defence and since in the present case, the passport was impounded by the Government without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, the order was null and void, and, in the alternative, if Section 10(3)(c) were read in such a manner as to exclude the right of hearing, the section would be infected with the vice of arbitrariness and it would be void as offending Article 14. These were the only grounds taken in the Petition as originally filed and on 20th July, 1977 the petition was admitted and rule issued by this Court and an interim order was made directing that the passport of the petitioner should continue to remain deposited with the Registrar of this Court pending the hearing and final disposal of the Petition.",Constitutional Case
"5. It is obligatory upon the applicant to show sufficient cause due to which he was prevented from continuing to prosecute the proceedings in the suit or before the higher Court. Here there is admittedly, a delay of 778 days in filing the application for bringing the legal representative on record. To explain this delay, the applicant has filed a one page application stating that they were not aware of the pendency of the appeal before the Court and came to know, only in March, 2010 from their counsel that the case would be listed for final disposal during the vacations in May, 2010. Then the applications, as already noticed, were filed on 15 th April, 2010. In order to examine the reliability and worthiness of the alleged sufficient cause for condonation of delay, it will be appropriate to refer to paragraph 2 of the application which is the only relevant paragraph out of the four paragraph application:

""That the LRs. of the applicants are residing on different addresses because the LRs. of the appellant/deceased are in service and they were not aware of the pendency of any appeal before this Hon'ble Court. However, when the letter from the counsel for Sh. Balwant Singh were received at home at Ambala that the appeal is being listed for final hearing during vacation in the month of May, 2010 then these LRs. came to know about the pendency of the appeal. Thereafter these LRs. contacted the counsel in the month of March, 2010 to find out the position of the case. When they contacted the counsel at New Delhi these LRs. the counsel was told about the death of Sh. Balwant Singh which had taken place in November, 2007. It was further pointed out to the counsel that the LRs. were not aware about the pendency of the appeal in this Court or about the requirement of law to bring the LRs. on record after the death of Balwant Singh.

"8. The respondent herein, had agreed to purchase land bearing S.No.594/B situated at village Kapra of Keesara Mandal of Ranga Reddy District. The agreement of sale was entered into on 25.1.1989 and as there was breach of performance of the contract on the part of the prospective vendor, a suit being O.S. No.1416 of 1997 was filed before the II Additional Senior Civil Judge, Hyderabad and the same was decreed. When the sale deed was not executed pursuant to the decree, Execution Petition No.5 of 2000 was filed. An officer of the Court was deputed to present the sale deed, which was stamped according to the directions of the Senior Civil Judge.

9. The registering authority raised objection with regard to the quantum of non-judicial stamp on which the sale deed was engrossed. By letter no.288/2000 dated 19.2.2000, the registering authority, the Sub-Registrar, Malkajigiri, Ranga Reddy District, conveyed to the Second Senior Civil Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad that the document has to be referred under Section 47A and as a condition precedent for such reference, called upon the party i.e. the respondent herein, to pay duty on 50% of the differential amount according to the estimate made by him. Against this demand the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court.

11. A counter affidavit was filed by the State Government in the writ petition. The relevant paragraphs in the counter affidavit are quoted below :

""In reply to the allegations made in the affidavit it is submitted that a sale deed was executed by II Senior Civil Judge, City Civil Court on 6.1.2000 and presented before me on 7.1.2000 through one of the staff members. The sale deed was admitted to registration and kept pending for want of clarification with regard to market value. The market value is arrived at Rs.6,17,80,500/- as per the market value guidelines for 33 acres 12 guntas whereas the sale deed executed was for a consideration of Rs.2,40,000/-. Thus there is huge loss to the Government Exchequer to a tune of Rs.70,77,160/- in stamp duty. Therefore, I sought clarification from the District Registrar, R.R. District (2nd Respondent). The 2nd respondent in his letter dated 473/G1/2003 dated 9.2.2000 ordered me to take action under Section 47A of Indian Stamp Act for determination of market value. Hence the action taken by the 3rd respondent i.e. Sub- Registrar, Malkajgiri is true and proper in the matter.
In reply to the allegations made paras 6 to 8 of the petitioner's affidavit it is submitted that the petitioners are liable to pay 50% of the deficit amount as per the Indian Stamp (A.P. Amendment) Act, 1998. The appeal filed by the petitioner is without any merits and is liable to be dismissed with a direction to the petitioner that 50% of the deficit amount assessed by the Sub-Registrar concerned and as per the directions of the Hon'ble Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad should be deposited before a reference could be made under Section 47A of the Indian Stamp Act, as amended through Act No.8 of 1998. It is submitted that the proviso under Section 47A(2) was amended and the amendment has come into force with effect from 1.5.1998.

The notice stated in the clearest terms in paragraph (1) that ""Sealed tenders in the prescribed form are here by invited from Registered IInd Class Hoteliers having at least 5 years' experience for putting up and running a IInd Class Restaurant and two Snack bars at this Airport for a period of 3 years"". The latest point of time upto which the tenders could be submitted to the 1st respodent was stipulated in Paragraph 7 of the notice to be 12 p.m. On 25th January, 1977 and it was provided that the tenders would be opened on the same date at 12.30 hours. Paragraph (8) of the notice made it clear that ""the acceptance of the tender will rest with the Airport Director who does not bind himself to accept any tender and reserves to himself the right to reject all or ally of the tenders received without assigning any reasons therefore "" There were six tenders received by the 1st respondent in response to the notice and one of them was from the 4th respondents of offering a licence fee of Rs. 6666.66 per month, and the others were from Cafe Mahim, Central Catering Service, one A. S. Irani, Cafe Seaside and Care Excelsior offering progressively decreasing licence fee very much lower than that offered by the 4th respondents. The tenders were opened in the office of the Airport Director at 12.30 p.m. On 25th January, 1977 and at that time the 4th respondents were represented by their sole proprietor Kumaria. A. S. Irani was present on behalf of himself, Cafe Mahim, Cafe Seaside and Cafe Excelsior and there was one representative of Central Catering Service. The tenders of Cafe Mahim, Central Catering Service, Cafe Seaside and Cafe Excelsior were not complete since they were not accompanied by the respective income tax certificates, affidavits of immovable property and solvency certificates, as required by cl. (9) of the terms and conditions of the tender form. The tenders of A. S. Irani was also not complete as it was not accompanied by an affidavit of immovable property held by him and solvency certificates. The only tender which was complete and fully complied with the terms and conditions of the tender form was that of the 4th respondents and the offer contained in that tender was also the highest amongst all the tenders. Now it is necessary to point out at this stage that while submitting their tender the 4th respondents had pointed out in their letter dated 24th January, 1977 addressed to the Airport Director that they had 10 years' experience in catering to reputed commercial houses, training centres, banks and factories and that they were also doing considerable outdoor catering work for various institutions. This letter showed that the 4th respondents had experience only of running canteens and not restaurants and it appeared that they did not satisfy the description of ""registered IInd Class Hotelier having at least 5 years' experience"" as set out in paragraph (1) of the notice inviting tenders. The Airport officer, therefore, by his letter dated 15th February, 1977 requested the 4th respondents to inform by return of post whether they were a ""registered IInd Class Hotelier having at least 5 years experience"" and to produce documentary evidence in this respect within 7 days. The 4th respondents pointed out to the Airport officer by their letter dated 22nd February, 1977 that they had, in addition to what was set out in their earlier letter dated 24th January, 1977, experience of running canteens for Phillips India Ltd. and Indian oil Corporation and moreover, they held Eating House Licence granted by the Bombay Municipal Corporation since 1973 and had thus experience of 10 years in the catering line. It appears that before this letter of the 4th respondents could reach Airport officer, another letter dated 22nd February, 1977 was addressed by the Airport officer once again requesting the 4th respondents to produce documentary evidence to show if they were ''a registered Ilnd Class Hotelier having at least 5 years experience"". The 4th respondents thereupon addressed another letter dated 26th February, 1977 to the Director pointing out that they had considerable experience of catering for various reputed commercial houses, clubs, messes and banks and They also held an Eating House Catering Establishment (Canteen) Licence as also a licence issued under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. The 4th respondents stated that their sole proprietor Kumaria had started his career in catering line in the year 1962 at Hotel Janpath, Delhi and gradually risen to his present position and that he had accordingly ""experience equivalent to that of a IInd Class or even 1st Class hotelier."" This position was reiterated by the 4th respondents in a further letter dated 3rd March, 1977 addressed to the Director. This information given by the 4th respondents appeared to satisfy the 1st respondent and by a letter dated 19th April, 1977 the 1st respondent accepted the tender of the 4th respondents on the terms and conditions set out in that letter. The 4th respondents accepted these terms and conditions by their letter dated 23rd April, 1977 and deposited with the 1st respondent by was of security a sum of Rs. 39,999.96 in the form of fixed Deposit Receipts in favour of the Ist respondent and paid to the 1st respondent a sum of Rs. 6666.66 representing licence fee for one month and other amounts representing water, electricity and conservancy charges. The 4th respondents thereafter executed and handed over to the Ist respondent an agreement in the form attached to the tender on 1st May, 1977. The 4th respondents also got prepared furniture, counters and showcases as also uniforms for the staff, purchased inter alia deep freezers, water coolers, electrical appliances, icecream cabinets, espresso coffee machines, crockery, cutlery and other articles and things and also engaged the necessary staff for the purpose of running the restaurant and the two Snack bars But the Ist respondent could not hand over possession of the requisite sites to the 4th respondents, since A. S. Irani was running his restaurant and snack bars on these sites under a previous contract with the 1 st respondent and though that contract had come to an end, A. S. Irani did not deliver possession of these sites to the Ist respondent. The 4th respondents repeatedly requested the 1st respondent and the Airport Director who is the 2nd respondent in the appeal, to hand over possession of the sites and pointed out to the that the 4th repondents were incurring losses by reason of delay in delivery of possession, but on account of the intransigence of A. S. Irani the Ist respondent could not arrange to hand over possession of the sites to the 4th respondents.

Meanwhile one K. S, Irani who owned Cafe Excelsior filed Suit No. 6544 of 1977 in the City Civil Court, Bombay against the respondents challenging the decision of the Ist respondent to accept the tender of the 4th respondents and took out a notice of motion for restraining the 1 st respondent from taking any further steps pursuant to the acceptance of the tender. K. S. Irani obtained an ad- interim injunction against the respondents but after hearing the respondents, the City Civil Court vacated the ad-interim injunction and dismissed the notice of motion by an order dated 10th october, 1977. An appeal was preferred by K. S. Irani against this order, but the appeal was dismissed by the High Court on 19th october, 1977. Immediately thereafter, on the same day, the Ist respondent handed over possession of two, sites to the 4th respondents and the 4th respondents proceeded to set up snack bars on the two sites and started business of catering at the two snack bars. These two sites handed over to the 4th respondents were different from the sites occupied by A.S. Irani, because A. S. Irani refused to vacate the sites in his occupation. So far as the site for the restaurant was concerned, the Ist respondent could not hand over the possession of it to the 4th respondents presumably because there was no other appropriate site available other than the one occupied by A. S. Irani. Since A. S. lrani refused to hand over possession of the sites occupied by him to the Ist respondent, even though his contract had come to an end, and continued to carry on the business of running the restaurant and the snack bars on these sites, the Ist respondent was constrained to file suit No. 8032 of 1977 against A. S. Irani in the City Civil Court at Bombay and in that suit, an injunction was obtained by the 1st respondent restraining A. S. Irani from running or conducting the restaurant and the snack bars or from entering the premises save and except for winding up the restaurant and the snack bars. A. S. Irani preferred an appeal against the order granting the injunction, but the appeal was rejected and ultimately a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court was also turned down on 31st July, 1978.

This was, however, not to be the end of the travails of the 4th respondents. for, as soon as the appeal preferred by K. S. Irani against the order dismissing his notice of motion was rejected by the High Court on 19th October, 1977, A. S. Irani filed another suit being suit No. 8161 of 1977 in the City Civil Court, Bombay on 24th October,1977 seeking mandatory injunction for removal of the two snack bars put up by the 4th respondents. This was one more attempt by A. S. Irani to prevent the 4th respondents from obtaining the benefit of the contract awarded to them by the Ist respondent. He, however, did not succeed in obtaining ad- interim injunction and we are told that the notice of nation taken out by him is still pending in the City Civil Court.

It will thus be seen that A. S. Irani failed in his attempts to prevent the 4th respondents from obtaining the contract and enjoying its benefit. The 4th respondents put up two snack bars on the sites provided by the 1st respondent and started running the two snack bars from 1 9th october? 1977. The restaurant however, could not be put up on account of the inability of the Ist respondent to provide appropriate site to the 4th respondents and, therefore, the licence fee for the two snack bars had to be settled and it was fixed at Rs. 4.50O/- per month by mutual agreement between the parties. But it seems that the 4th respondents were not destined to be left in peace to run the two snack bars and soon after the dismissal of the appeal of A. S. Irani on l9th october, 1977 and the failure of A. S. Irani to obtain an ad interim mandatory injunction in the suit filed by him against the 1st and the 4th respondents, the appellant filed writ petition No. 1582 of 1977 in the High Court of Bombay challenging the decision of the 1st respondent to accept the tender of the 4th respondents. The writ petition was moved before a Single Judge of the High Court on 8th November, 1977 after giving prior notice to the respondent and after hearing the parties, the learned Single Judge summarily rejected the writ petition. The appellant preferred an appeal to the Division Bench of the High Court against the order rejecting the writ petition and on notice being issued by the Division Bench, the 1st and the 4th respondents filed their respective affidavits in reply showing cause against the admission of the appeal. The Division Bench after considering the affidavits and hearing the parties rejected the appeal in limine on 21st February, 1978. The appellant thereupon filed a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court and since it was felt that the questions raised in the appeal were of seminal importance, this Court granted special leave and decided to hear the appeal at an early date after giving a further opportunity to the parties to file their respective affidavits. That is how the appeal has now come before us for final hearing with full and adequate material placed before us on behalf of both the parties.

Now, on this view we should have ordinarily set aside the decision of the,- 1st respondent accepting the tender of the 4th respondents and the contract resulting from such acceptance but in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, we do not think it would be a sound exercise of discretion on our part to upset that decision and void the contract. It does appear from the affidavits filed by the parties that the appellant has no real interest in the result of the litigation, but has been put up by A. S. Irani for depriving the 4th respondents of the benefit of the contract secured by them. We find that a number of proceedings have been instituted for this purpose from time to time by A. S. Irani either personally or by instigating others to take such proceedings. The first salvo in the battle against the 4th respondents was fired by K. S. Irani, proprietor of Cafe Excelsior, who filed a suit challenging the decision of the 1st respondent to accept the tender of the 4th respondents, but in this suit he failed to obtain an interim injunction and his appeal was dismissed by the High Court on 19th October, 1977. It is significant that when the tenders were opened in the office of the Airport Director, Cafe Excelsior was represented by A. S. Irani, which shows that either Cafe Excelsior was a nominee of A. S. Irani or in any event K. S. Irani, proprietor of Cafe Excelsior, was closely connected with A. S. Irani. Moreover, it is interesting to note that though the tender of the 4th respondents was accepted as far back as 19th April, 1977, K. S. Irani did not adopt any proceedings immediately but filed the suit only after A. S. Irani was informed by the Airport Director on 22nd August, 1977 that a final order has been received from the Ministry requiring A. S. Irani to immediately close down his restaurant and snack bars. It is also a circumstance not without significance that A. S. Irani did not immediately take any proceeding for challenging the acceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents, but filed a suit in his own name only after the appeal of K. S. Irani was dismissed by the High Court on 19th October, 1977. These circumstances clearly indicate that the suit was filed by K. S. Irani at the instance of A. S. Irani or in any event in concert with him and when the suit of K. S. Irani failed to achieve the desired result, A. S. Irani stepped into the arena and filed his own suit. This suit was for a mandatory injunction seeking removal of the two snack bars which had in the meantime' been put up by the 4th respondents pursuant to the acceptance of their tender by the 1st respondent. But in this proceeding also A. S. Irani failed to obtain an ad- interim injunction. It was only after the failure to obtain interim relief in these two proceedings, one by K. S. Irani and the other by A. S. Irani, that the appellant filed the present writ petition in the High Court of Bombay challenging the decision of the 1st respondent to accept the tender of the 4th respondents. Now, it appears from the record that the appellant was at the material time conducting a restaurant called Royal Restaurant and Store which was owned in partnership by three persons, namely, J. K. Irani, K. M. Irani and G. S. Irani. G. S. Irani is the brother of A. S. Irani and he was managing and looking after the restaurant of A. S. Irani at the airport. It would, therefore, be a fair inference to make that the appellant was well connected with A. S. Irani and from the manner in which proceedings with a view to thwarting the attempt of the 4th respondents to obtain the benefit of their contract, have been adopted one after the other in different names, it does appear that the appellant has filed the writ petition at the instance of A. S. Irani with a view to helping him to obtain the contract for the restaurant and the snack bars. It is difficult to understand why the appellant should have waited until 8th November, 1977 to file the writ petition when the tender of the 4th respondents was accepted as far hack as 19th April, 1977. The explanation given by the appellant is that he was not aware of the acceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents but that is a rather naive explanation which cannot be easily accepted It is not possible to believe that the appellant who was so well connected with A. S. Irani and G. S. Irani did not know that A. S. Irani had failed to obtain the contract for running the restaurant and the snack bars and that this contract had been awarded to the 4th respondents as a result of which A. S. Irani was being pressed to close down his restaurant and snack bars. We have grave doubts whether this writ petition was commenced by the appellant bona fide with a view to protecting his own interest. Moreover, the writ petition was filed by the appellant more than five months after the acceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents and during this period, the 4th respondents incurred considerable expenditure aggregating to about Rs. 1,25,000/- in making arrangements for putting up the restaurant and the snack bars and in fact set up the snack bars and started running the same. It would now be most inequitous to set aside the contracts of the 4th respondents at the instance of the appellant. The position would have been different if the appellant had filed the writ petition immediately after the acceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents but the appellant allowed a period of over five months to elapse during which the 4th respondents altered their position. We are, therefore, of the view that this is not a fit case in which we should interfere and grant relief to the appellant in the exercise of our discretion under Article 136 read with Article 226 of the Constitution.",Civil Case

"The captioned eight appeals and one cross appeal have been filed at the instance of Assessee and Revenue against the respective orders of the Learned Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), Ahmedabad arising in the matter of assessment order passed under s. 143(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (here-in- after referred to as ""the Act"") relevant to the Assessment Year as mentioned in the cause title.

4. It is the 2nd round of litigation before us. Therefore, we find pertinent to take a note about the history of the case in brief which goes like this. There were certain pieces of lands which were acquired on lease for a period of 99 years by Torrent Power AEC and Torrent Power SEC from M/s Surat Municipal Corporation and Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority in the earlier years on the initial payment of premium for ₹ 2,000/- per square meter and ₹ 1/- per square meter as rent on yearly basis. These expenses were incurred by the different assessee (Torrent Power AEC and Torrent Power SEC) as discussed above which were claimed as towards the payment for acquiring the commercial rights. Therefore, the same were treated as intangible assets by the respective companies and accordingly depreciation was claimed at the rate of 25% on such intangibles assets according to the provisions of section 32 of the Act. Subsequently, these companies namely, Torrent Power AEC and Torrent Power SEC were amalgamated and became one company i.e. the assessee company. Accordingly, the assessee also claimed depreciation on the impugned amount treating the lease premium as intangible asset for the year under consideration.

As per the authorities below, the facts of the case on hand were different with the facts of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Accordingly, the disallowance was made by the authorities below qua the lease premium paid by the assessee in the earlier ITA nos.1577/AHD/2015 with 8 others Asstt. Years 2006-07 & others year. For the ready reference, the relevant extract of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd reported in 329 ITR 479 are extracted below:

6. The facts are not in dispute. The lease agreement entered into between the assessee and GIDC has been analyzed and relevant terms summarized by the Tribunal. It is not necessary to refer to the said terms in detail in the present proceedings. Suffice it to state that the Tribunal, on appreciation of the deed in question, has recorded following findings of fact :
""It is not disputed that the land which has been leased out to the assessee did not cease to be belonging to GIDC, the lessor. The lease deed was registered because as per the Registration Act, it is compulsorily registrable, but it has not changed the ownership. It is not also disputed that the lease rent is very nominal and by obtaining this land by lease the capital structure of the company has not been changed. . . . . . Thus, by this payment the assets of the assessee company had not been increased because the land continued to be the land of GIDC. The benefit the assessee got is only of an advantage of carrying on the business more profitably by paying nominal rent on the land. The issue can be considered in another angle. It cannot be disputed that if the land is not obtained by the assessee it would not be possible for it to carry on the business.........""
13.4 Now, we proceed to examine the facts of the present case viz a viz the facts of the Sun pharmaceutical industries Ltd in the manner as tabulated below:

S.No. Facts in case of assessee Facts in case of Sun Comment Pharma
1. Property belong to AMC Property belong to GIDC and SMC
2. Lease period 99 year Lease period 99 year Same in both
3. Lease taken with Not known development right
4. No proof that owner ship Ownership right rest transferred with GIDC
5. Used the land for Power Used the land for Purpose is similar receiving station business purposes in both case ITA nos.1577/AHD/2015 with 8 others Asstt. Years 2006-07 & others
6. Lease premium or down Premium or down Only difference in payment of Rs. 2000 per payment of Rs. quantification but Sq. Mtr. and yearly 48,02,616/- only principle are same nominal amount of Rs. 1 per Sq. Mtr.
13.5 On minute analysis as discussed above we note that there was no difference in the facts of the assessee with the facts of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd except the amount of yearly payment of rent. But such difference in the amount of rent cannot be a criteria distinguish the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.
13.6 It is also pertinent to note that the authorities below have also given different reasoning while disallowing the claim of the assessee. But to our mind, the authorities below cannot improve the case beyond the direction of the ITAT. Without prejudice to the above, it is also pertinent to note that the entries in the books of accounts cannot be a criteria to allow or to disallow the claim of the assessee until and unless it contravenes the provisions of law. In holding so we draw support and guidance from the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Kedarnath Jute Mfg. Co. Ltd. vs. CIT reported in 82 ITR 363, where the Hon'ble Apex court held as under:
Whether the assessee is entitled to a particular deduction or not will depend on the provision of law relating thereto and not on the view which the assessee might taken of its right nor can the existence or absence of entries in the books of account be decisive or conclusive in the matter.
13.7 Moving further, we also note that the genuineness of the expenses have nowhere been doubted by the authorities below. Thus, the claim of the assessee even pertaining to the earlier assessment year cannot be denied merely on the reasoning that such claim relates to the earlier assessment year i.e. treating as prior period items. There was no change in the rate of tax in the year under consideration viz a viz in the earlier assessment year. Accordingly, there is no loss to the revenue ITA nos.1577/AHD/2015 with 8 others Asstt. Years 2006-07 & others even claim of the assessee is allowed in the later assessment year. In holding so we draw support and guidance from the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in case of Nagri Mills Co. Ltd. reported in 33 ITR 681, the relevant portion of the finding is extracted herein:
""We have often wondered why the Income-tax authorities, in a matter such as this where the deduction is obviously a permissible deduction under the Income-tax Act, raise disputes as to the year in which the deduction should be allowed. The question as to the year in which a deduction is allowable may be material when the rate of tax chargeable on the assessee in two different years is different; but in the case of income of a company, tax is attracted at a uniform rate, and whether the deduction in respect of bonus was granted in the assessment year 1952-53 or in the assessment year corresponding to the accounting year 1952, that is in the assessment year 1953-54, should be a matter of no consequence to the Department; and one should have thought that the Department would not fritter away its energies in fighting matters of this kind.""
13.18 In the result appeal filed by the assessee is allowed.

16. The facts in brief are that the assessee in the present case is a limited company and engaged in the business of generation and distribution of electricity. The assessee in the year under consideration has earned exempted income amounting to Rs. 1,74,63,194/- only. However, the assessee has not made any disallowance against such exempted income under the provisions of section 14A read with rule 8D of Income Tax Rule on the reasoning that the investments, yielding the exempted income, was made out of interest free funds available with ITA nos.1577/AHD/2015 with 8 others Asstt. Years 2006-07 & others it. Therefore, there cannot be any disallowance on account of interest expenses. Likewise, the assessee contended that it has not put any effort in earning the impugned exempted income. Therefore, there cannot be any disallowance of administrative expenses.

33.2 However, the AO disregarded the contention of the assessee by observing that the income from the maintenance of streetlights activity is not derived from the power distribution activity. The maintenance activity is altogether separate and independent to the power distribution activity. It is not necessary for providing the maintenance services to AMC that the assessee should be engaged in the activity of power distribution. Accordingly, the AO excluded the amount of Rs. 1,44,61,003/- from the eligible amount of deduction under section 80IA of the Act.

81.1 The assessee alternatively submitted that major portion of the impugned receipt i.e. an amount of Rs. 10,04,30,079/- out of the total receipt of Rs. 11,57,69,618/- represents the sale of capital goods which were shown as assets in its balance sheet. The assessee in support of its contention filed a chart showing the breakup of different assets belonging to the eligible units which is reproduced as under:

The unit-wise details of component of the crap are as under:
 Particulars          Ahmedabad          Surat                 Bhiwandi           Total

 Transformer(80%)     35700217           14298027              0                  49998244

81.2    Accordingly, the assessee submitted before the AO during the assessment
proceedings that the amount of sale as shown income in the profit and loss account can be reduced by adjusting the same against the capital assets as discussed in the table above. Thereafter, the depreciation should be allowed on the remaining amount.
ITA nos.1577/AHD/2015 with 8 others Asstt. Years 2006-07 & others 81.3 However, the AO was of the view that there is no scrap in the power distribution activity. Therefore the impugned amount of miscellaneous income cannot be subject to deduction under section 80-IA of the Act. Accordingly the AO excluded the sum of ₹ 11,57,69,618/- from the amount eligible for deduction under section 80-IA of the Act.
81.4 However, the AO accepted the alternate plea of the assessee to the limited extent by observing that the amount of scrap sale as discussed in the table given above can be adjusted against the assets shown in the balance sheet which will reduce the amount of depreciation and simultaneously the income of the assessee will increase. Thus the assessee can claim higher amount of deduction under section 80-IA of the Act. But all these adjustments will be made only for the limited purpose of computing the deduction under section 80-IA of the Act without reducing the amount of scrap sale for ₹ 10,04,30,079/- from the total income of the assessee.
82. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the learned CIT (A).",Administrative Case
"The conspectus of facts The historic elections to Parliament, recently held across the ,country, included a constituency in Punjab called 13- Ferozepore Parliamentary constituency. It consisted of nine assembly segments and the polling took place on March 16, 1977. According to the calendar notified by the Election Commission, the counting took place in respect of five assembly segments on March 20, 1977 and the, remaining four on the next day. The appellant and the third respondent were the principal contestants. It is stated by the appellant that when counting in all the assembly segments was completed at the respective segment headquarters, copies of the results were given to the candidates and the local tally telephonically communicated to the returning officer (respondent 2). According to the scheme the postal ballots are to arrive at the returning officer's headquarters at Ferozepore where they are to be counted. The final tally is made when the ballot boxes and the returns duly reach the Ferozepore headquarters front the various segment headquarters. The poll proceeded as ordained, almost to the very last stages, but the completion of the counting at the constituency headquarters in Ferozepore was aborted at the final hour as the postal ballots were being counted-thanks to mob violence allegedly mobilised at the instance of the third respondent., The appellant's version is that he had all but won on the total count by a margin of nearly 2000 votes when the panicked opposite party havoced and halted the consummation by muscle tactics. The postal ballot papers were destroyed. The, ballot boxes from the Fazilka segment were also done away with en route, and the returning officer was terrified into postponing the declaration of the result. On account of an earlier complaint that the returning officer was a relation of the appellant, the Election Commission (hereinafter referred to as Commission) had: deputed an officer of the Commission-Shri IKK Menon-as observer of the poll process in the constituency. He was present as the returning officer who under compulsion had postponed the concluding 3 p.m. onwards. Thus the returning officer had the company of the observer with him during the crucial stages and controversial eruptions in the afternoon of March 21. Shortly after sunset, presumably, the returning officer who under compulsion had postponed the concluding part of the election, reported the happenings by wireless massage to the Election Commission. The observer also reached Delhi and gave a written account and perhaps an oral narration of the untoward events which marred what would otherwise have been a smooth finish Lo, the election.

Disturbed by the disruption of the declaratory part of the election, the appellant, along with a former Minister of the State, met the Chief Election Commissioner (i.e. the Commission) at about 10.30 A.M. on March 22nd, with the request that he should direct the returning officer to declare the result of the election. Later in the day, the Commission issued an order which has been characterised by the appellant as a law-less and precedentless cancellation, of the whole poll, acting by hasty hunch and without rational appraisal of facts. By the 22nd of_March, when the Election Commission made the impugned order, the bulk of the electoral results in the country bad beamed in. The gravamen of the grievance of the appellant is that while he had, in all probability, won the poll, he has been deprived of this valuable and hard-won victory by the arbitrary action of the Commission going contrary to fairplay and in negation of the basic canons of natural justice. Of course the Commission did not stop with the cancellation but followed it up a few days later with a direction to hold a fresh poll_for the whole constituency, involving all the nine segments, although there were no complaints about the polling in any of the constituencies and the ballot papers of eight constituencies were available intact with the returning officer and only Fazilka segment ballot papers were destroyed or demanded on the way, (plus the postal ballots). It must also, be mentioned here that a demand was made, according to the version, of the third respondent, for recount in one segment which was,, unreasonably, turned down. The observer, in his report to the Election Commission, also mentioned that in two polling stations divergent practices were adopted in regard to testing valid and invalid votes. To be more pracise, Shri IKK Menon mentioned' in his report that at polling station no. 8, the presiding officer's seal on the tag as well as the paper seal of one box was broken. But the ballot papers contained in that box were below 300 and would not have affected the result in the normal course. In another case in Jalalabad assembly segment, the assistant returning officer had rejected a number of ballot papers of a polling station on the score that they were not signed by the presiding officer. In yet another case it was reported that the ballot papers were neither signed nor stamped but were accepted by the assistant returning officer as valid, al- though the factum was not varified by Shri Menon with the assistant returning officer. Shri Menon, in his report, seems to have broadly authenticated the story of the mob creating a tense situation leading to the military being summoned. According to him only the ballot papers of Fazilka assembly segment were destroyed, not of the. other segments. Even regarding Fazilka, the result-sheet had arrived. So, far as Zira assembly segment was concerned, some documents (not the, ballot papers) had been snatched away by hooligans. The observer had asked the returning officer to send a detailed report over and above the wireless message. That report, dated March 21, reached the Commission on March 23, but, without waiting for the, report we need not probe the reasons for the hurry-the Commission issued the order cancelling the poll. The Chief Election Commissioner has filed a laconic affidavit leaving to the Secretary of the Commission to go into the details of the facts, although the Chief Election Commissioner must himself have had them within his personal ken. This aspect also need not be examined by us and indeed cannot be, for reasons which we will presently set out.

Meanwhile, pursuant to the, Commission's direction, a re- poll was held. Although the appellant's name lingered on the ballot he did not participate in the re-poll and respondent 3 won by an easy plurality although numerically those who voted were less than half of the, previous poll. Of course, if the Commission's order for re-poll fails in law, the second electoral exercise has to be dismissed as a stultifying futility. Two things fall to be mentioned at this stage, but, in passing, it may be stated that the third respondent had complained to the Chief Election Commissioner that the assistant returning officer of Fazilka segment had declined the request for recount unreasonably and that an order for re-poll of the Fazilka assembly part should be made 'after giving personal hearing'. Meanwhile, runs the request of the third respondents 'direct the returning officer to withhold declaration of result of 13 Ferozepore parliament constituency'. We do not stop to make inference from this document but refer to it as a material factor which may be considered by the tribunal which, eventually, has to decide, the factual controversy.

A short description of the legislative project in some more detail may be pertinent, especially touching on the polling process in the booths and the transmission of ballot boxes from the polling stations to the returning officer's ultimate counting station and the crucial prescriptions regarding annuoncements and recounts and declarations. We do not pronounce upon the issues regarding the stage for and right of recount. the validity of votes or other factual or legal disputes since they fall for decision by the Election Court where the appellant has filed an election petition by way of abundant caution.",Constitutional Case
"This Court issued notice to the wife and directed the Appellant-husband to file his Income Tax Returns and Assessment Orders for the period from 2005-2006 till date. He was also directed to place a photocopy of his passport on record. By a further Order dated 11.09.2019, the Appellant-husband was directed to make payment of the arrears of Rs.2,00,000 towards interim maintenance to the wife; and a further amount of Rs.3,00,000, which was due and payable to the wife towards arrears of maintenance, as per his own admission. By a subsequent Order dated 14.10.2019, it was recorded that only a part of the arrears had been paid. A final opportunity was granted to the Appellant-husband to make payment of the balance amount by 30.11.2019, failing which, the Court would proceed under the Contempt of Courts Act for wilful disobedience with the Orders passed by this Court.

(vi) By the Order dated 25.08.2020, it was noted that the Appellant had filed an Affidavit dated 23.08.2020 wherein he had admitted and acknowledged that an amount of Rs.5,00,000 was pending towards arrears of maintenance to the Respondent No.1-wife. The Appellant was directed to pay 50% of the arrears within a period of 4 weeks to the Respondent No.1, failing which, he was directed to remain present before the Court on the next date of hearing. The Counsel for the husband placed on record a chart of various proceedings pending between the parties. Taking note of the aforesaid facts, we considered it appropriate to refer the matter for mediation by Mr. Shridhar Purohit, Advocate, a well-known Mediator in Nagpur, to resolve all disputes pending between the parties, and arrive at an overall settlement.

(vii) On 08.10.2020, we were informed that the mediation had failed. The husband appeared before the Court, and made an oral statement that he did not have the financial means to comply with the Order of maintenance payable to the Respondent No.1-wife, and had to borrow loans from his father to pay the same. He however stated that he had paid the maintenance awarded to the son, and would continue to do so without demur. Both parties addressed arguments and filed their written submissions.

The Registry is directed to forward a complete copy of the pleadings, alongwith the written submissions filed by the parties, and the record of the proceedings in the present Criminal Appeal, to the Family Court, Nagpur. The present Criminal Appeal is disposed of accordingly.

(v) On the basis of the pleadings filed by both parties and the Affidavits of Disclosure, the Court would be in a position to make an objective assessment of the approximate amount to be awarded towards maintenance at the interim stage.",Civil Case

"2. The orders of the AO are impugned on law, being without jurisdiction and in utter disregard and violation of the statutory provisions as well as the rules of natural justice and also on facts, that is to say; objecting to the computation of the undisclosed income (UDI) of the block period mentioned in the respective impugned orders. Our decision in these appeals depend upon the facts which we have ascertained from the appeal records as well as from the assessee's counsel Shri Santhanakrishnan and Sri Swaminathan, Chartered Accountant as well as the Departmental Representative, Shri T. Gorakanathan and Shri Krishna Rao, Assessing Officer. Since these are connected appeals, they are being disposed of through this single order for the sake of convenience.

4. In the warrants of authorisation (search warrants) issued by the Director of Income-tax, Madras, it is mentioned that information has been laid before him and on the consideration thereof he had reason to believe that :

""If a summons under sub-s. (1) of s. 37 of the Indian IT Act, 1922, or under sub-s. (1) of s. 131 of the IT Act, 1961, or a notice under sub-s. (4) of s. 22 of the Indian IT Act, 1922, or under sub-s. (1) of s. 142 of the IT Act, 1961 issued to Mr. T. Shantakumar, 91, Venkatasamy Road (West), R. S. Puram, Coimbatore (name of the person) to produce, or cause to be produced, books of account or other documents which will be useful for, or relevant to, proceedings under the Indian IT Act, 1922 or under the IT Act, 1961, he would not produce, or cause to be produced, such books of account or other documents are required by such summons or notice.""
On p. 2 of the Search Warrant the Director has stated as under :

""Shri T. Shantakumar is in possession of any money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or thing and such money, bullion, or jewellery or other valuable article or thing represents either wholly or partly income or property which has not been, or would not be, disclosed for the purposes of the Indian IT Act, 1922, or the IT Act, 1961; and whereas I have reason to suspect that such books of account, other documents, money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or thing have been kept and are to be found in No. 91, Venkatasamy Road, (W), R. S. Puram, Coimbatore.""
5. Similarly the Dy. Director of Inspection (Investigation), Coimbatore, Sri V. S. Kothari, in the search warrant dt. 30th August, 1995 issued by him in statutory Form No. 45 has stated that information was laid before him and on the consideration thereof he had reason to believe that :

""if a summons under sub-s. (1) of s. 37 of the Indian IT Act, 1922, or under sub-s. (1) of s. 131 of the IT Act, 1961, or a notice under sub-s. (4) of s. 22 of the Indian IT Act, 1922, or under sub-s. (1) of s. 142 of the IT Act, 1961, is issued to Shri T. Shantakumar (name of the person) to produce, or cause to be produced, books of account or other documents which will be useful for, or relevant to, proceedings under the Indian IT Act, 1922, or under the IT Act, 1961, he would not produce, or cause to be produced, such books of account or other documents as required by such summons or notice.""
Again on p. 2 of the said search warrant, it is stated as under :

""And whereas I have reason to suspect that such books of account, other documents, money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or thing have been kept and are to be found in Vispark Jewellery Manufacturers (P) Ltd., Mettupalayam Road.
This is to authorise and require you as given above (name of the Deputy Director of Income-tax or the Dy. CIT or the ITO).""
6. Pursuant to these search warrants/authorisations, search operations were carried out on 30th August, 1995 and certain materials were seized duly recorded in the Panchnama drawn at the search place, copies of which were also given to the respective searched persons or their agents. Copies of four search warrants have been given by the AO on 12th August, 1997 along with the written submissions filed by him in these appeals.

7. On the basis of searches conducted on 30th August, 1995 an appraisal report was prepared on 14th November, 1995 by the Dy. Director of Income-tax (Inv.) Coimbatore, which was forwarded to the AO, who was possessed of the jurisdiction over these appellants by virtue of notification under s. 120 of the IT Act, 1961, from the CIT, Coimbatore, bearing No. 7/1988-89/CBE dt. 15th June, 1988, which was modified subsequently by the CIT, Coimbatore, through Notification No. 3/1991-92/CBE dt. 27th June, 1991. The CIT, Coimbatore by Notification No. 25/1995-96/CBE in C.No. 1439(25)/95-96 dt. 23rd January, 1996 by exercising powers under s. 127 of the Act transferred the cases of M/s Vispark Jewellery and Manufacturers (P) Ltd. (appellant No. 3 being ITA No. 95/MDS/1997), Sri T. Shantakumar, Smt. Dr. Usha K. Mehta (appellant No. 4 being ITA No. 96/MDS/1997), Smt. Sheetal Shantakumar and M/s M. R. Agro Trust, from various AOs to the Dy. CIT, Special Range-I, Coimbatore and the said notification came into effect from 31st January, 1996.

8. On the basis of the appraisal report, the AO issued notices to the above mentioned appellants in terms of s. 158BC of the Act r/w s. 158BD. These notices were served on the abovementioned appellants on 14th March, 1996. An oath statement on 1st January, 1995 was recorded by the Assistant Director of Inspection from Shri T. Shantakumar in terms of s. 132(4) wherein he admitted that he would be disclosed a sum of Rs. 40 lakhs for the block period to cover up any shortage or deficiencies in the group of search cases. Copy of the oath statement of Shri Shantakumar is filed in the paper-book, in the separate appeal relating to Shri. T. Shantakumar, being ITA No. 1883/MDS/1996.

9. Though the AO has framed the assessments on the above mentioned appeals under s. 143(3) r/w s. 158B of the Act of 31st March, 1997, yet he issued notices to all these appellants under s. 158BC of the Act and we deem it fit to reproduce the contents from one of the notice issued to M/s Kirtilal Kalidas & Co. (ITA No. 93/MDS/1997) :

""In pursuance of the provisions of s. 158BC of the IT Act, 1961, you are required to prepare a true and correct return of your total income including the undisclosed income in respect of which you as individual/HUF/firm/company/AOP/BOI/local authority are assessable for the block period mentioned in s. (a) of the IT Act, 1961.
The return should be in the prescribed Form No. 28 and be delivered in this office within 16 days of service of this notice, duly verified and signed in accordance with the provisions of s. 140 of the IT Act, 1961.""
The above mentioned appellants did not file their returns within the time given in the notices issued to them respectively under s. 158BC of the Act because according to them there was no undisclosed income for the block period of 10 years and moreover the notices issued on them were wholly illegal and without jurisdiction. However, subsequently, the returns for the block period were filed by the above mentioned appellants, the details of which are as follows :

 (a) M/s Kirtilal Kalidas & Co.               Nil income
    (Appellant No. 1)
(b) M/s M. R. Agros.                        Rs. 1,47,162
    (Appellant No. 2)                   (as income from other
                                    sources as undisclosed income).
(c) M/s Vispark Jewellery &                  Nil income
    Manufacturers (P) Ltd.
    (Appellant No. 3)
(d) Dr. Ms. Usha M. Mehta                   Rs. 3,58,560
    (Appellant No. 4)                  (as undisclosed income)
 

10. The AO after scrutinising the seized materials and after obtaining the details/clarifications from the respective appellants/ assessees, completed the block assessment on these appellants on 31st March, 1997 computing the UDI, details of which are extracted below :

(i) Kirtilal Kalidas & Co.
12. The additional of Rs. 4,78,350 has been made on account of unexplained gold jewellery which has been dealt with by the AO in the impugned order in this appellant's case in para. 4 of the impugned order from pp. 2 to 5. According to the AO the gold jewellery as per the assessee's books on 30th August, 1995 was 1,60,433.250 gms. whereas as per the physical inventory made on that day, the quantity of gold and gold jewellery was to the extent of 137.986 kgs. The AO, through his letter dt. 8th May, 1996 demanded explanation for the shortfall of 22.447 kgs. and the assessee through its reply dt. 22nd May, 1996 had filed a reconciliation statement submitting that there were some mistakes in totalling and some items omitted to be totalled in the physical inventory prepared by the searching party. In para 4.1 the AO has recorded the assessee's stock statement of the quantity of gold jewellery which came to 1,60,433.250 gms in respect of total 11,838 items on different items of gold jewelleries. After exchange of letters and verification and cross-verification of different statements furnished by the assessee, the shortage was worked out at 1,042.154 gms. which was valued by the AO @ 459 per gram of 22 ct. gold as per information of Jewellery Association Manual and by doing so the addition worked out to Rs. 4,78,350 which was treated as undisclosed income for the block period.

16. In this case, a sum of Rs. 2,10,43,312 is considered as undisclosed income of the assessee being unexplained investment in gold and undisclosed profits from unaccounted turnover. A sum of Rs. 9,42,706 is also treated as undisclosed income being wastage of gold. The total undisclosed income has been worked out in the assessment order in a sum of Rs. 2,19,86,020 and income-tax at 60% and surcharge at 15% of the tax has been worked out and demanded aggregating to Rs. 1,51,70,353. The detailed working of the undisclosed income and the tax is given at p. 7 of the assessment order of this appellant-company.

17.1 In response to notice under s. 158BC dt. 11th March, 1996, which was served on the appellant-assessee on 19th March, 1996, a return was filed declaring undisclosed income in a sum of Rs. 3,58,560 and tax of Rs. 2,15,136 was paid along with a letter dt. 3rd February, 1997. In reply to queries raised by the AO in letter dt. 6th March, 1997 replies were filed on 14th March, 1997, and 27th March, 1997. The explanation of the assessee in respect of the items of gold jewellery and diamond as well as cash was explained as under :

Cash Rs. 90,907
------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.2. The appellant through letter dt. 13th March, 1997, in order to explain the discrepancy raised by the AO in letter dt. 6th March, 1997, it was submitted that 14 ct gold jewellery was converted into 22 ct. gold jewellery and on conversion the gold jewellery found and the gold jewellery available with her and her mother Smt. Maniben K. Mehta were as under :

------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was further submitted that the difference between the quantity of gold found at the time of search and admitted for wealth-tax purposes by them was 2,335 gms., and that her mother's jewellery was deposited with M/s Kirtilal Kalidas & Co. totalling 1,737.700 gms. and in regard to the balance of gold jewellery which remained unexplained totalling 593.300 gms., the assessee submitted that the same has been regularly used by her mother on periodical visits. In regard to diamonds, it was submitted that on the day of search diamond to the extent of 101.22 cts. were found and that in her and in her mother's wealth-tax returns 110.20 cts. have been admitted leaving a different of 9.02 cts. which the assessee told to the AO that her mother during her visits to Bombay might have left the diamonds with her brothers. In the course of hearing on 27th March, 1997, the AO informed the authorised representative of the appellant that the assessee in the course of her statement under s. 132(4) had submitted that she purchased the gold jewellery weighing 902.800 gms. from April to July, 1995, for which the ITO demand explanation. The AO also wanted to know from the assessee that the difference in quantity of 14 cts gold jewellery should not be treated as her unaccounted investment. To these, the assessee's representative M/s Suri & Co. through their letter dt. 27th March, 1997, submitted as under :

""The assessee has already submitted that the purchase of jewellery mentioned by her at the time of search operation was only remarking of various jewellery as per the designs and latest styles. It is submitted on behalf of the assessee that the assessee has not acquired any fresh goods during the period. It is further submitted that the assessee had substantial jewellery already in her possession and she has not further purchased any gold but only has made frequent changes in the designs.
In the reply already submitted the assessee has already considered the gold at 22 ct. equivalent weight even in respect of 14 cts of gold as for the purpose of wealth-tax, the valuation was taken only on equivalent basis. It is submitted that the entire quantity of 14 cts. of gold of 781 gms. was considered at 497 gms. in the reply submitted by the assessee in page No. 2 of letter dt. 14th March, 1997. Similarly for the tallying the total jewellery held by the assessee and her mother all the gold jewellery has been considered on equivalent weight of 22 ct. for easier tallying. It is submitted that the assessee has considered the entire jewellery including 14 ct. jewellery.""
17.3. The assessee had admitted in her wealth-tax return (latest wealth-tax return filed for asst. yr. 1993-94), gold jewellery of 22 cts. of 2,165.700 gms, and diamonds of 20.50 cts. After taking into account these items admitted, the balance of gold jewellery and diamonds explainable are as under :

22 ct. gold jewellery 1,002.30 gms.
14 ct. gold jewellery 781.00 gms.
             Jattar                          754.00 gms.
             Diamonds                         80.72 cts.
 

17.4. The assessee submitted that the above gold jewellery belonged to her mother and her mother had declared the same in her wealth-tax return also. But the AO did not accept this in view of the sworn statement given on 30th August, 1995 under s. 132(4), in answer to question No. 6 she had stated that none of her jewellery or diamond is available in the house. The precise question and answer given by the assessee's mother is as under :
""Q. No. 6 : Approximately, how much gold/diamonds jewellery do you have in this house ?
Ans : I don't have any jewellery in this house but my daughter, Usha's jewellery is available in this house. She is not able to tell as to the quantity.""
17.5. The assessee in the course of statement recorded under s. 132(4) of the IT Act on 30th August, 1995 that she hereself categorically submitted that she had purchased gold jewellery and diamonds and coloured stones studded jewellery during the months of April to May, 1995 and July to August, 1995. The exact question and answer is extracted below :

""Q. No. 4 : Your wealth-tax statement relevant for the asst. yr. 1993-94 shows your jewellery holding to be 2,165.7 gms. and diamonds to be 20.50 cts. On physical verification, it was found that there is jewellery as follows as belonging to you :-
 (a) 22 ct. gold jewellery                               3,168 gms.
(b) 14 ct. gold jewellery                                 781 gms.
(c) Jattar (which approximately contains 20% gold)        754 gms.
(d) Diamonds                                           101.22 cts.
 

How do you explain the difference ? 
 

Ans : 497 gms., being s. No. 76, 78, 79, 80 & 89, are the gold jewellery purchased by me during July-August, 1995. Further, I have also purchased diamonds and coloured stones studded jewellery in gold, being items Nos. 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 and 71, aggregating 405.8 gms. were purchased during April-May 1995. The balance of 251 gms., I am not able to explain at present. All the 14 ct. jewellery have been bought in foreign countries an as they are not valued much in India. I have not declared them in my wealth-tax statement. Regarding the Jattar jewellery which has less gold content, have been discussed in my wealth-tax return.
As stated in earlier para, some diamond studded jewellery have been purchased during the year. The difference in weight can be reconciled only after the diamonds are valued by an approved diamond valuer.""
After exchange of letters in respect of gold jewellery and diamonds which we have extracted above, the AO drew inference that the assessee has failed to explain satisfactorily the sources of gold jewellery and diamonds. According to the AO, the unexplained gold jewellery and diamonds was to the tune of Rs. 27,86,400 which was treated as undisclosed income of the block period. The details which are worked out by the AO at p. 7 of the assessment order, as under :

Estimated value Rs.
Gold jewellery 22 cts.                    1,002.300 gm.

                                                         -------------
 

Accordingly this sum of Rs. 27,86,400 was treated as undisclosed income and brought to tax.
17.6. Regarding the cash of Rs. 90,907 found in the residence, it was explained as under (in answer to question No. 5) :
""A sum of Rs. 50,000 is out of my accumulated savings. Sum of Rs. 18,800 found in several envelopes represent gifts received by me on various occasions. Sum of Rs. 20,000 has been drawn from my bank account at Indian Overseas Bank, R. S. Puram branch. The balance amounts to the payments to be made for the Purchase of sarees, received from my friends.""
But during the course of assessment proceedings, it was submitted that Rs. 80,000 belonged to her and Rs. 10,000 was given by M/s M. R. Agros in which she was a trustee and it was received by her for the purpose of agricultural and other developmental activities in the land owned by the trust. The assessee was also unable to give the exact details of expenses spent for agricultural operations of the land belonging to the trust.

17.7 The AO did not believe the explanation tendered by the assessee and was of the opinion that the sum of Rs. 10,000 was not belonging to M. R. Agros Trust and the same was not handed over to her for agricultural purposes. This sum was, therefore, treated by the AO as undisclosed income of this appellant-assessee of the block period and subjected to tax. Thus, the total undisclosed income of Dr. Usha K. Mehta (the appellant-assessee, in this case) was worked out in a sum of Rs. 31,54,960 on which tax of Rs. 18,92,976 at 60 per cent as per s. 113 of the Act was levied and demanded. This has given rise to the present appeal before us.

19. The Departmental Representative, Shri Goraknathan assisted by Shri Krishna Rao, the AO vehemently repelled all the arguments and submissions of the assessees' counsel, Shri Santhanakrishnan. According to the Departmental Representative, the search operations were carried out only on Shri T. Santhakumar and the searches at the premises of other appellants-assessees were only consequential and collateral and, therefore, the assessments made on 31st March, 1997 were not barred by limitation under s. 158BE(1) of the Act, but were saved pursuant to the provisions of s. 158BE(2), as all the assessments impugned in these appeals were made under s. 158BD of the Act r/w s. 158BC for which notices were issued on 11th March, 1996. In order to convince us the Departmental Representative drew our attention to the name of Shri T. Shanthakumar appearing on the first page of the search warrants issued by the Director of Inspection, Madras, as well as the Dy. Director of Inspection, Coimbatore. According to Shri Goraknathan, the search has to be considered in the case of Shri T. Santhakumar only, who was the main man behind the firm of M/s Kirtilal Kalidas & Co. (Appellant No. 1), M/s Vispark Jewellery Manufacturers (P) Ltd. (Appellant No. 3) and M/s M. R. Agros (Appellant No. 2). Accordingly to him since the assessments were made on the present appellant-assessees in accordance with the provisions of s. 158BE(2) they were within the limitation period and this Tribunal should not annual or quash the impugned assessments.",Administrative Case
"2. We feel that a prefatory note, though not the detailed facts of the case, is necessary for disposal of these appeals and writ petition. The facts culled out from various documents placed before this Court are as follows:

3. The Ministry of Defence, Government of India approved in August 1980 a proposal forwarded by Army Headquarters (HQ) recommending, inter-alia, the introduction of 155 mm calibre medium gun both towed and self-propelled to meet its defence operational requirements. The choice for obtaining the said gun system/guns was short listed in December, 1982 to (1) M/s. Sofma of France (2) M/s. A.B. Before of Sweden (briefly called 'Before') (3) M/s. International Military Services of U.K. and (4) M/s. Voest Alpine of Austria. In November 1985, there was a further short listing of Sofma and Before. Finally, the order was placed by the Government of India with Before on 24th March 1986 for the supply of 410 numbers (400 plus 10 free) of 155 mm Field Howitzer 77-B gun system/spare guns vide contract No. 6(9)/84/D (GS-IV) for a total amount of SEK 8410.66 million (Swedish Kroners) (equivalent to about Rs. 1437.72 crores or Rs. 14377.2 million). The related contract for supplying the gun package (towed) and other related agreements/contracts were concluded and signed on 24th March 1986 with M/s. A.B. Before.

4. On 17 April, 1987, some leading newspapers of our country gave prominent coverage to a Swedish Radio Broadcast made in the previous day, broadcasting that bribes had been paid to senior Indian politicians and key Defence figures to win the contract awarded by the Government of India to M/s. Before of Sweden on 24 March, 1986.

6. The Government of India on 17th April 1987 issued a statement denying the allegations contained in the news items based on the broadcast report, made by the Swedish Radio and Television in connection with the arms order placed on Swedish firm, Before and categorized the news item as false, baseless and mischievous. The part of the said statement reads thus:

Government's policy is not to permit any clandestine or irregular payments in contracts. Any breach of this policy by any one will be most severely dealth with.
7. On 20th April, 1987, the Minister of Defence (Shri K.C. Pant) made a suo-motu statement on the subject in Lok Sabha stating inter-alia that on the eve of finalising the contract, in response to a reiteration of Government's policy and a demand for confirmation, M/s. Before had replied, vide their letter of the 10th March, 1986 that they did not employ any Representative/Agent in India for the project: However, for administrative services, e.g. hotel bookings, transportation, forwarding of letters, telexes etc., they use the services of a local firm.

11. On 20th April 1987, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister intervening in the debates in the Lok Sabha stated:

...And like Panditji has said now, you show us any evidence, we do not want proof. We will bring the proof. You show us any evidence that there has been involvement of middlemen, of payoffs or of bribes or commissions, we will take action and we will see that nobody however high-up is allowed to go free.
13. During the course of the discussion in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, several members demanded a probe with full details by a Parliamentary Committee. When the matter stood thus on 4th June 1987, the Swedish Embassy in India, forwarded a copy of the Report dated 1st June 1987 of the Swedish National Audit Bureau (SNAB for short) with a note to the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, stating that what was made available to the Government of India was only one part of the Report of SNAB but not report in its entirety and the rest was withheld by the Government of Sweden on the bank secrecy requirements. The summary of the observations of the SNAB as extracted in the report of the JPC are as follows:

...that an agreement exists between AB Before and ...* concerning the settlement of commission subsequently to the FH 77 deal; and
- that considerable amounts have been paid subsequently to, among others, AB Before' previous agent in India.
(*Names not disclosed)
14. However, the report did not disclose the names of the recipients of kickbacks as indicated above.

17. Therefore, certain substitute motions were moved by the Parliament Members and ultimately after a discussion in both the houses, the JPC was constituted with the appointment of its chairman on 28.8.88 totally consisting of 30 elected members - 20 from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha for making the inquiry into the following matters:

(i) Whether the procedures laid down for the acquisition of weapons and systems, were adhered to in the purchase of the Before' gun;
(ii) to ascertain the identity of the persons who received, and the purpose for which they received, payments of the following amounts:
(a) SEK 170-250 million
(b) SEK 29.5 million
(c) SEK 2.5 million from M/s. Before (as referred to in the Report of the Swedish National Audit Bureau, received by the Government of India on June 4, 1987);
(iii) arising out of the enquiry, if there is prima facie evidence that M/s. Before have in addition to payments mentioned in (ii) above, made any other payments for securing the Indian contracts, the identity of the persons who received such payments shall be ascertained;
(iv) to determine if any Indian laws/rules/regulations have been violated either by M/s. Before or by persons as indicated in (ii) and (iii) above.
18. Of the elected members, two members by name Shri Mahabir Prasad and Smt. Sumati Oraon resigned w.e.f. 16.3.1988. One other member, Dr. K.G. Adiyodi died and three other members of the Committee ceased to be members of the Committee consequent on their retirement from Rajya Sabha w.e.f. 2.4.1988. In place of the members, who resigned and a member who died, these other members from the Lok Sabha were elected.

22. It is further seen from the Report of the JPC that Mr. Lars Gothlin, Chief Jurist and Senior Vice-President of the Noble Industries was examined by the JPC and during the examination his attention was drawn to a statement of Mr. Thumbhole, Chairman of the Noble Industries, which is the holding company of M/s. A.B. Before that so far as he was aware, payments had been made to Indians or to an Indian company in connection with the contract. Of course, the Chief Jurist finding himself in a piquant situation, said that the words of Dr. Thumbhole were twisted. (Vide paras 7.41 and 7.56 of the Report of JPC).

23. In spite of the conclusion in the Report of the JPC, allegations of malpractices in the deal with Before, payments of kickbacks and receipt of illegal gratification were persistently reiterated and the matter was recently agitated. Meanwhile, there was a change of Government. In the aforesaid circumstances, the Superintendent of Police, CBI/DSPE/ACU-IV, New Delhi registered a First Information Report on 22nd January 1990 in Crime No. RC 1(A)/90/ACU-IV under Section 120-B read with Sections 161, 162, 163, 164 and 165-A of the Indian Penal Code read with Sections 5(2), 5(1)(d) and 5(2)/5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with Sections 409, 420, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code against 14 accused of whom three are named, they being (1) Shri Martin Ardbo, former President of M/s. A.B. Before, Sweden, (2) Shri. Chadha alias Win Chadha, S/o Shri Assa Nand, President of M/s. Anatronic General Corporation/Anatronic General Companies Ltd., C/4, Main Market, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi and Shri G.P. Hinduja, New Zealand House, Hay Market, London SW-1. The rest of the 11 accused are stated in general as directors/employees/holders/beneficiaries of account code and public servants of the Government of India. The preface of the First Information Report shows that the case was registered ""on the basis of reliable information received from certain sources, certain facts and circumstances that have become available, through media reports dated 1st June 1987 of the Swedish National Audit Bureau, certain facts contained in the report dated 22nd April 1988 of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) and the report dated 28th April 1988 of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)"". The FIR gives a detailed sequence of the events relating to the purchase of guns from M/s. A.B. Before, Sweden and the related agreements entered thereupon in violation of the Government's policy i.e. not to involve any agent and the existing law of this land. Various allegations are made mention of in the FIR regarding the payments of bribes/kickbacks and receipt of illegal gratification, the debates made in the Parliament, the correspondences among the parties and the various findings of the JPC. It is further averred in the First Information Report that even in the letter dated 3.10.86, sent to the Swedish National Bank, Before had referred to some of the payments to Svenska Inc. and the code name 'Mont Blanc' as ""commission payments"" and that the payment to M/s. Moresco/Moineao/SA/Pitco, Geneva was deposited by Before in three code name accounts, namely, ""Lotus"" in Suisse Bank Corporation, 2 Rue de la Confederation 1204, Geneva; ""Tulip"" in Manufacturers Hannover Trust Company, 84 Rue du Rhone, 1204, Geneva and ""Mont Blane"" in Credit Suisse, 2 Place Belle Air, 1204, Geneva and that these payments to code name accounts are without mentioning or disclosing the payers' names. Ultimately, reference was also made in paragraph 112 of the FIR to the statement of Mr. Thulholm, Chairman of Noble Industries reading:

As the report of JPC discloses, Shri Thulholm, Chairman of Noble Industries had stated that so far as he was aware, payments had been made to Indians or to an Indian company in connection with the contract. Shri Thulholm had also stated that he could not guarantee that bribes had not been paid. Before being a subsidiary of Noble Industries, these statements of Shri Thulholm are important.
27. The Special Judge also directed certain documents to be sent along with this letter of rogatory. Further, the learned Judge has put up a note reading thus:

Needless to mention that no (sic - any) observation made in this order shall tantamount to expression of opinion at any subsequent stage of enquiry or trial.
29. The Special Judge, Shri V.S. Aggarwal dismissed that petition by his order dated 18th August 1990 observing thus:

It goes without saying that Letter Rogatory had been issued by Shri R.C. Jain, then Special Judge, Delhi on recording his satisfaction that it should be issued. The petitioner has appended along with the application the copy of the order passed by the Cantonal Court, Geneva. It is accompanied by its English translation. It clearly recites that application for judicial assistance should be sent back after completing the procedural formalities mentioned in the order. It cannot, therefore, be said that the letter of request had been rejected. It further does not call for any fresh reconsideration in this regard pertaining to the order passed by my learned predecessor.
31. Consequent upon the above findings, the Special Judge dismissed the petition stating, ""This request of the learned Counsel cannot be accepted."" Thereafter, the Special Judge issued (1) Note of Compliance and (2) Amended letter rogatory on August 22, 1990.

35. In compliance of the above direction of this Court, Mr. Justice Chawla heard Mr. Ram Jethmalani, Sr. counsel who appeared on behalf of Janata Dal and Mr. Prashant Bhushan. It appears Mr. Jethmalani was constrained to make a request to Mr. Justice Chawla to refuse himself from the case, which request, of course, was rejected by the learned Judge. Thereafter, a petition for recusation was filed which was also dismissed. Mr. Justice Chawla after hearing the learned Counsel for Mr. H.S. Chowdhary as well as the intervenes, passed his final impugned order on 19th December 1990, dismissing the revision petition, the relevant portion of the said order read thus:

In my opinion, the case of the petitioner does not fall within the ambit and scope of the law laid by the Supreme Court in Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India [1986] Supp SCC 553. So, I hold that the petitioner has no locus standi to file the present revision petition and is thus not maintainable on his behalf. The same is hereby dismissed.
As a consequence of the dismissal of the present petition, holding that the petitioner has no locus standi, the applicants have no right to be impleaded and their impalement/intervention applications are also rejected.
This is not the end of the matter. There is yet another process by which the court can take judicial notice of any illegality being committed by any court, with a view to prevent the injury being caused to the known or unknown aggrieved party.",Constitutional Case
"3. Brief facts of the case are that returns of income for the assessment years 2007-08 to 2009-10 were filed on 31.10.2007, 30.9.2008 and 29.9.2009 declaring loss at (-)46,78,40,252/-, Rs.18,53,52,406/- and Rs.2,54,05,015/- respectively for the assessment years 2007-08 to 2009-09. There is no dispute between parties that cases of the assessee for all these years were taken up for scrutiny assessment and due notice under sections 143(2)/142(1) were issued and served upon the assessee. Since there were international transactions of the assessee with its AE, therefore reference under section 92CA(1) were sent by the AO to the TPO in all these years. The ld.TPO has passed orders under section 92CA(3) of the Act on 20.10.2010, 28.10.2011 and 22.1.2013 respectively. The international transactions ITA No.955 /Ahd/2012 and Others ACIT Vs.

4. Let us first take the facts in the assessment year 2007-08 on this issue.
However, while making adjustment in respect of interest, TPO did not allow set off of interest already charged by the appellant. Since the interest worked out by the This is total interest which should've been charged at ALP, obviously Interest already charged by the appellant has to be reduced making TP adjustment. Accordingly assessing officer is directed to reduce interest already charged by the appellant from the total interest chargeable from the AEs. The adjustment of such net amount computed is confirmed,

11. Brief facts of the case are that in the assessment year 2007-08, he assessee has extended foreign currency loan amounting to Rs.24,50,70,500/- to Dishman Europe Ltd., and Rs.5,36,70,000/- to Dishman Pharma Solution AG. The assessee has charged total interest of Rs.40,93,995/- at the rate of LIBOR plus 1%. The ld.TPO has observed that one of the AEs. borrowed funds from European bank at the rate of EURIBOR plus 3.75%. The ld.TPO confronted the assessee as to why this rate be not taken for benchmarking rate of interest required to be charged by the assessee. In response to the query of the AO, it was contended by the assessee that loan had been granted to the AE in order to create infrastructure facilities for the smooth operation of the AE and this is needed to sustain, survive and grow in most competitive market. The assessee further submitted that basis of charging of interest was cost of funds to the assessee, as it had raised the funds by issuing FCCB at nominal cost 0.5% to 1%. It has also stated that in any case the assessee has charged interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 1%, which is according to the market conditions. The ld.TPO rejected the contentions of the assessee and observed that it was not granted for creating infrastructure facilities. According to the ld.TPO one of the AEs. had borrowed money from European market at the rate of EURIBOR plus 3.75% which could be applied on the loans granted to its AE. Accordingly the ld.TPO has made adjustment of Rs.87,19,932/- in the assessment year 2007-08. On same principle, adjustments have been recommended in the subsequent two years. The ld.CIT(A) has appreciated the controversy but concurred by the ld.TPO. Further, the ld.CIT(A) has accepted alternative contentions of the assessee. A credit of Rs.40,93,995/- charged by the assessee as interest in the assessment year 2007-08 has been given against the adjustment ITA No.955 /Ahd/2012 and Others ACIT Vs. Dishman Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals Ltd. & Others recommended by the ld.TPO. On similar lines, interest which has been charged by the assessee from its AE has been allowed as set off against ultimate interest computed by the TPO by adopting the rate of EURIBOR plus 3.75%.

14. Brief facts of the case in the assessment year 2007-08 are that the assessee given corporate guarantee for Dishman Europe Ltd. of Rs.541.01 lakhs and Rs.2170.13 lakhs. It has further given guarantee on behalf of its AE, M/s. Dishman Pharma Solution for a sum of Rs.23199.96 lakhs. According to the ld.TPO whenever a guarantee is being extended then the bank in India used to charge guarantee fee at 2% of the guaranteed money. Since the assessee has not charged anything from its guarantee, therefore, ld.TPO has recommended an upward adjustment of Rs.5,18,22,200/- in the assessment year 2007-08 on account of guarantee fee.

5.5 So far as condition (c) is concerned, if is admitted facts that the DEL and DPS are wholly owned subsidiary companies of the Appellant and therefore they are associate enterprise of the Appellant as per the provisions of S.92A of the Act.

44. Brief facts of the case in the assessment year 2007-08 are that the assessee has shown dividend income of Rs.2,44,60,691/- which has been claimed as exempt income under section 10(34) of the Act. According to the ld.AO, no expenditure was offered by the assessee being attributable to earning of such exempt income. Therefore, he issued a show cause notice inviting the explanation of the assessee as to why expenditure ought not to be disallowed with help of Rule 8D. The assessee filed detailed reply, and after considering the case of the assessee, the ld.AO has worked out administrative cost at 0.5% of average investment of Rs.1.36 lakhs and partly interest ITA No.955 /Ahd/2012 and Others ACIT Vs. Dishman Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals Ltd. & Others expenditure he made an estimated disallowance in way at Rs.3,93,000/- in the assessment year 2007-08. Under similar lines, he has made disallowance in other two years.",Administrative Case
"3. Shri Swaran Singh (the appellant’s husband) died in a road accident when the Maruti car in which he was travelling with Varinder Singh (husband of respondent No. 2 and the father of respondent Nos. 3 and 4) went out of control. Varinder Singh, who was driving the vehicle also suffered multiple injuries and died on the spot.",Civil Case
"31. The Government has failed to discharge its statutory obligations While issuing the impugned notifications. the Government is directed to reexamine the whole issue after taking into account all relevant considerations for the period subsequent to March 1, 1981. The Government cannot be deprived of the legitimate duty payable on imported newsprint. [371D-E]

During the pendency of these petitions while the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 was amended levying 40% ad valorem plus Rs. 1,000 per MT as customs duty on newsprint, the auxiliary duty payable on all goods subject to customs duty was increased to 50% ad valorem. But by reason of notifications issued under section 25 of the Customs Act, 1962 customs duty at a flat rate of Rs. 550 per MT and auxiliary duty of Rs. 275 per MT are now being levied on newsprint i.e. in all Rs. 825 per MT is now being levied.

But by notifications issued on February 28,1982 under section A 25 (2) of the Customs Act, 1962, which were issued in supersession of the notification dated March 1, 1981, Rs. 550 per tonne was imposed as customs duty on newsprint and auxiliary duty was fixed at Rs. 275 per tonne. In all Rs. 825 per tonne of newspaper has to be paid as duty. The high sale price of newsprint had by that time gone up above Rs. 5,600 per tonne.",Constitutional Case
"4. The facts in brief are that the assessee company is a public sector undertaking engaged primarily in providing long term finance for construction of houses for residential purposes or undertake housing and urban development programmes in the country. For the year under consideration, the assessee company filed its return of income declaring total income of Rs. 496,24,42,636/- on 28.10.2005 ,which was processed under Section 143(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short ""the Act"") and the case was selected for scrutiny through notice dated 07.08.2006 issued under Section 143(2) of the Act. Subsequently, the assessee filed a revised return of income on 27.10.2006 declaring income of Rs. 491,12,38,624/-. The assessment was completed by making various additions against which the assessee filed an appeal before the ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). Aggrieved by the decision of the ld. Commissioner of 3365 & 3366/Del/2013; 1561 & 1562/Del/2012 Housing & Urban Development Corp. Ltd.

consideration was submitted, therefore, he disallowed the said prior period expenses. Before, the ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), the assessee submitted the details of the expenses under various heads, like, salary & allowance (Rs.7.0 lakhs), repair and maintenance (Rs. 9.0 lakhs), publicity (Rs. 1.0 lakh), interest on drawings (Rs.42.0 lakhs), Reset charges (Rs. 1.0 lakh) and other expenses (Rs. 5.0 lakhs). Further, the assessee submitted that it had also accounted for prior period income of Rs. 712 lakhs, and thus, the assessee has offered net prior period income of Rs. 647 lakhs. However, the ld CIT(A) following the finding of the ld. CIT(A) in assessment year 2004-05, sustained the disallowance.

7.3 We have heard the rival submissions and perused the material on record. The assessee has placed reliance on the judgment of Rotork Controls India (P.) Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra). In that case the assessee made a provision on account of warranty claims likely to arise on the sales effected by the assessee and to cover up that expenditure. The claim was allowed by the Hon'ble Court following matching concept of income and expenditure, according to which, if revenue is recognized , the cost incurred to earn that revenue including warranty costs has to be fully accounted for. The obligation of provision in that case was as a result of past events of claims. In the case of present assessee, the estimation is not as result of any past historical events. Thus, according to us the ratio of the said judgements is not applicable to the facts of the assessee. In the case of the assessee, claim of depreciation on the value of properties has been duly allowed by the ld. Assessing Officer, however, he has only denied depreciation on stamp duty and registration charges in respect of these properties, which have not been registered during the year. To address the controversy, it is important to refer the relevant provision of the Act. The depreciation is governed by the provisions of section 32 of the Act, which reads as under:

9. Ground no. 5 is regarding the issue of disallowance of Rs. 3,27,500/- under Section 14A of the Act. The ld. Assessing Officer observed that the dividend income of Rs. 13,10,000/- was claimed as exempt by the assessee, however, no expenses corresponding of the same was disallowed by the assessee under Section 14A of the Act. The explanation of the assessee was that no 3365 & 3366/Del/2013; 1561 & 1562/Del/2012 Housing & Urban Development Corp. Ltd.

deduction for non-recognition of the interest income. The Assessing Officer held that NPA was to be classified as per Rule 6EB of the Rules and not as per the amended guidelines of the National Housing Banks, which were made effective from 31.03.2005. Further in the absence of any detailed working given by the assessee, he allowed 50% of the revenue de-recognition of Rs. 54,13,48,468/- and balance amount of Rs. 27,06,74,234/- was disallowed and added back to the income of the assessee. The ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) agreed with the findings of the ld. Assessing Officer, therefore, he sustained the addition.",Administrative Case
"6. Upon receipt of a complaint on the basis of a cheque for an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- made in favour of M/s Advantage Strategic Consulting Private Limited (ASCPL) by INX Media, the investigation wing of the Income Tax Department proceeded to investigate the matter and the relevant information was sought from the FIPB, which in turn, vide its letter dated 26.05.2008 sought clarification from the INX Media which justified its action saying that the downstream investment has been authorised and that the same was made in accordance with the approval of FIPB. It is alleged by the prosecution that in order to get out of the situation without any penal provision, INX Media entered into a criminal conspiracy with Sh. Karti Chidambaram, Promoter Director, Chess Management Services Pvt. Ltd. and the appellant-the then Finance Minister of India. INX Media through the letter dated 26.06.2008 tried to justify their action stating that the downstream investment has been approved and the same was made in accordance with approval.

7. The FIR further alleges that for the services rendered by Sh. Karti Chidambaram to INX Media through Chess Management Services in getting the issues scuttled by influencing the public servants of FIPB unit of the Ministry of Finance, consideration in the form of payments were received against invoices raised on INX Media by ASCPL. It is alleged in the FIR that the very reason for getting the invoices raised in the name of ASCPL for the services rendered by Chess Management Services was with a view to conceal the identity of Sh. Karti Chidambaram inasmuch as on the day when the invoices were raised and payment was received. It is stated that Sh. Karti Chidambaram was the Promoter, Director of Chess Management Services whereas ASCPL was being controlled by him indirectly. It is alleged that the invoices approximately for an amount of Rs.3.50 crores were falsely got raised in favour of INX Media in the name of other companies in which Sh. Karti Chidambaram was having sustainable interest either directly or indirectly. It is alleged that such invoices were falsely got raised for creation of acquisition of media content, consultancy in respect of market research, acquisition of content of various genre of Audio- Video etc. It is alleged that INX Media Group in his record has clearly mentioned the purpose of payment of Rs.10,00,000/- to ASCPL as towards “management consultancy charges towards FIPB notification and clarification”. Alleging that the above acts of omission and commission prima facie disclose commission of offence, CBI has registered FIR in RC No.220/2017-E-0011 on 15.05.2017 under Section 120B read with Section 420 IPC, Section 8 and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against the aforesaid accused.

9. The High Court dismissed the application refusing to grant anticipatory bail to the appellant by holding that “it is a classic case of money-laundering”. The High Court observed that “it is a clear case of money-laundering”. The learned Single Judge dismissed the application for anticipatory bail by holding “that the alleged irregularities committed by the appellant makes out a prima facie case for refusing pre-arrest bail to the appellant”. The learned Single Judge also held that “considering the gravity of the offence and the evasive reply given by the appellant to the questions put to him while he was under the protective cover extended to him by the court are the twin factors which weigh to deny the pre-arrest bail to the appellant”. Being aggrieved, the appellant has preferred this appeal.

27. Section 4 of PMLA deals with punishment for money laundering. Prior to Amendment Act 2 of 2013, Section 4 provided punishment with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and the fine which may extend to Rs.5,00,000/-. By Amendment Act 2 of 2013, Section 4 is amended w.e.f. 15.02.2013 vide S.O. 343(E) dated 08.02.2013. Now, the punishment prescribed under Section 4 of PMLA to the offender is rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and the offender is also liable to pay fine. The limit of fine has been done away with and now after the amendment, appropriate fine even above Rs.5,00,000/- can be imposed against the offender.",Criminal Case

"Challapan's case decided three appeals against a common judgment of the High Court of Rajasthan allowing the writ petitions filed by three railway servants. Challappan, the respondent in one of these appeals, was a railway-pointsman. He was arrested at Olavakkot Railway Station platform for disorderly, drunken and indecent behaviour and was prosecuted and convicted under section 51(a) of the Kerala Police Act. Instead of sentencing him, the sub-magistrate, Palghat, released him on probation under section of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958. Thereafter he was removed from service by the disciplinary authority of the Department, without holding any inquiry, on the basis of his conviction in the said criminal case. The order of removal from service was made under clause (i) of rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules. The Kerala High Court held that as no penalty was imposed upon him, clause (i) of rule 14 did not in terms apply, and allowed his writ petition. So far as the other two railway employees were concerned, one was convicted under section 3 of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, and the other under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. Both of them were released on probation and were similarly removed from railway service.

The respondent, Tulsiram Patel, was a permanent auditor in the Regional Audit Officer, M.E.S., Jabalpur. It appears that orders were issued by Headquarters, C.D.A. C.C., Meerut, stopping the increment of the Respondent for one year. One Raj Kumar Jairath was at the relevant time the Regional Audit Officer, M.E.S., Jabalpur. On July 27,1976, the Respondent went to Raj Kumar's office and demanded an explanation from him as to why he had stopped his increment whereupon Raj Kumar replied that he was nobody to stop his increment. The Respondent then struck Raj Kumar on the head with an iron rod. Raj Kumar fell down, his head bleeding. The Respondent was tried and convicted under section 332 of the Indian Penal Code by the First Class Judicial Magistrate, Jabalpur. The Magistrate instead of sentencing the Respondent to imprisonment applied to him the provisions of section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, and released him on his executing a bond of good behaviour for a period of one year. The Respondents appeal against his conviction was dismissed by the Sessions Judge, Jabalpur. The Controller General of Defence Accounts, who was the disciplinary authority in the case, imposed upon the Respondent the penalty of compulsory retirement under clause (i) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules. The said order was in the following terms :

""WHEREAS Shri T.R. Patel, Pt. Auditor (Account No.8295888) has been convicted on a criminal charge, to wit, under Section 332 of I.P.C., WHEREAS it is considered that the conduct of the said Shri T.R.Patel, Pt.Auditor,(Account No. 8295888) which has led to his conviction, is such as to render his further retention in the public service undesirable, Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by Rule 19(i) of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, the undersigned hereby direct that the said Shri T.R. Patel, Pt. Auditor, (Account No.8295888) shall be compulsorily retired from service with effect from 25.11.1980.""
Before dealing with the relevant facts, we may mention that the counter affidavit filed to the writ petition in both the said High Courts were unsatisfactory. At the hearing of these Appeals an application was made on behalf of the Appellants for leave to file a supplementary return. This application was granted by us in the interest of justice and the supplementary Return annexed to the said application was taken on the record. We will now briefly set out the facts which led to the passing of the impugned orders. The Respondents in Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982 are dismissed members of the CISF Unit at Bokaro Steel Plant of the Bokaro Steel Limited situate at Bokaro in the State of Bihar temporary security guard in the CISF Unit posted at Security Paper Mill at Hoshangabad in the State of Madhya Pradesh. We will first deal with the facts of Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982. The members of the CISF Unit at Bokaro had formed an all-India association in March 1979 and one Sadanand Jha, Respondent No. 1, was elected as its General Secretary. Thereafter, a country wide agitation was carried on for recognition of the said association. In June 1979 some of the members of the said association were called upon to meet the Home Minister at Delhi. A delegation of the said association went to Delhi. While there they staged a demonstration. Some of the demonstrators, including Sadanand Jha, were arrested. What happened thereafter can best be related by extracting paragraphs 3 to 9 of the supplementary Return filed by Shri Madan Gopal, the Deputy Inspector- General, CISF Unit of Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro, pursuant to the leave granted by this Court. These paragraphs read as follows :

""3. The said persons were arrested at Delhi, but subsequently released on bail. At Bokaro Steel Plant, the agitation which was going on assumed aggravated from on and from 27th May, 1979. Out of 1900 persons belonging to CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro about 1000 persons participated in the processions and violent demonstrations. The said employees indulged in agitational acts and violent indiscipline. The said personnel unleashed a reign of terror in the unit lines and openly incited others to disobey the lawful orders. The said persons indulged in several acts of violence and created a very serious law & order problem and an atmosphere of collective violence and intimidation. The said agitation and the violent activity reached a very serious proportion in the last week of June, 1979 with the result that Army had to be called by the State Authorities on 23.6.1979. Annexed hereto and marked Annexure AFD- I is the request from the Home Commissioner, Bihar Government to the Ministry of Defence, Government of India dated 23.6.1979 requesting for the deployment of the Army so as to restore normalcy in the area. The State Government had also deployed 9 Magistrates to assist the Army authorities as also the CRPF for restoring the normal conditions at the Bokaro Steel Plant. A copy of the order is enclosed herewith and market as Annexure AFD-II
4. On 24.6.1979, on seeing the arrival of the Army, the agitators started making preparations for armed resistance by putting up sand bags, flood lights and barricades in the CISF Lines. They had gained the control of CISF Lines and the Officers were not allowed to have any access to the Lines or to other ranks of CISF.
5. On 25.6.1979, the Army along with 9 Magistrates took up positions round the CISF Lines in the early hours and called upon the agitators to give up charge of the Armoury. Inspite of giving repeated warnings by the authorities to give up charge of the Armoury, the agitators did not give up arms, but, instead, resorted to violence. The agitators started firing at 0320 hours at the Army. The Army returned the fire. The said exchange of fire continued for 3 hours before the Army could spell out the violent retaliation of the agitators. The said violent exchange of fire resulted in the instant death of one Army Major and 2 more Army personnel were also killed as a result of firing by the CISF personnel.
6. It may also be stated that there were 22 death in the course of the said pitched battle, which went on for three hours between the violent armed agitators and the Army.
7. In regard to the aforesaid violent activities and the commission of offences, about 800 personnel were rounded up by the Army and later on arrested by the local police. It is pertinent to mention here that at the relevant time, about 1900 personnel were deployed in CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro. More than 1000 personnel participated in the aforesaid agitational activities. Besides the persons arrested by the authorities concerned, a substantial number of agitators were at large. Most of them either fled away or went underground and large number of arms and ammunitions were also with them. The search and seizure of arms and ammunition were going on and as a result thereof up till 1.7.1979, 65 rifles along with large quantity of ammunitions, 11 Molotov cooktails, 20 kgs. of sulphur, 20 kgs of glass chips and other explosives and 1048 empties of .303 ammunition were recovered from the area after the Army action. A copy of the FIR lodged in connection with aforesaid commission of offences is annexed herewith and marked as Annexure (AFD-III).
8. Notwithstanding the arrest of the said about 800 employees, as aforesaid, atmosphere at the Bokaro Steel Plant continued to be vitiated due to terror and collective fear and the functioning of the CISF Unit and its administration at Bokaro had completely broken down. It was only Army which could control the situation by its continued presence. The Army was withdrawn from the Bokaro Steel Plant only on or about 2.7.1979, however it may not be out of place to mention here that although the Army was withdrawn in the early July, 1979 but atmosphere of terror and tension continued for a couple of months. The CRPF continued performing security duties till Nov. 79. Besides this Bihar Military Police took charge of armoury from army and continued to perform some of armed duties of CISF as CISF Unit was not in a position to function normally for a considerable time. Even the State authority apprehended a dangerous situation after the Army action including threat to lives of senior officers of CISF.
9. In the meanwhile, having regard to the violent and disturbed situation which prevailed in the Bokaro Steel Plant as also the collective actions of violence, mass terror and intimidation and threats to supervisory and loyal staff, it was reasonably believed that any inquiry in accordance with the provisions of the Rules 34, 35 and 36 of CISF Rules, 1969 or in accordance with the requirements of Article 311(2) would be dangerous, counter productive and would aggravate the already existing dangerous situation. It was also reasonably believed that the circumstances were such as would make the holding of any inquiry self-defeating, subversive or would result in consequent detriment to public interest. It was in these circumstances that the concerned authorities formed reasonable nexus that any inquiry in accordance with the rules was reasonably impracticable and impugned orders were passed in view thereof.""
We have already held that in applying clause (c) of the second proviso the Governor of a State acts on his subjective satisfaction taking into consideration facts and factors which are not proper matters for judicial review. However, the claim of privilege was waived by the Government and all the materials produced at the hearing and inspection given to the other side. These materials disclose that an incident took place on January 18, 1981, at the annual Mela held at Gwalior in which one man was burnt alive. Some persons, including a constable from each of these two Forces, were arrested. These persons were remanded into judicial custody. On January 20, 1981, several members of these two Forces indulged in violent demonstrations and rioted at the Mela ground, demanding the release of their colleagues. They attacked the police station at the Mela ground, ransacked it and forced the operator to close down the wireless set. The situation became so dangerous that senior district and police officers had to approach the Judicial Magistrate at night and get the two arrested constables released on bail. The incident was discussed at a Cabinet meeting, a decision was taken and the advice of the Council of Ministers was tendered to the Governor of Madhya Pradesh who accepted it and issued the impugned orders. On further scrutiny some names were deleted from the list of dismissed personnel and some others included. As a result of this, some other members of these Forces began carrying on an active propaganda against the Government, visiting Jabalpur and other places in the State of Madhya Pradesh, holding secret meetings, distributing leaflets, and inciting the constabulary in these places to rise against the administration as a body in protest against the action taken by the Government. On this information being received, they too were similarly dismissed. These facts speak for themselves. The police normally oppose the grant of bail to an accused but here we have the paradoxical situation of some of the highest police and district officers going at midnight to the Magistrate's house to apply for bail for the accused. The police are the guardians of law and order. They stand guard at the border between the green valleys of law and order and the rough and hilly terrain of lawlessness and public disorder. If these guards turn law-breakers and create violent public disorder and incite others to do the same, we can only exclaim with Juvenal, ""Quis custodiet ipsos' Custodes?""- who is to guard the guards themselves?""

(Satires, VI,347). These facts leave no doubt that the situation was such that prompt and urgent action was necessary and the holding of a inquiry into the conduct of each of the Petitioners would not have been expedient in the interest of the security of the State. All these four Petitions, therefore deserve to be dismissed.
Final Orders in the Appeals and Writ Petitions For the reasons set out above, we pass the following orders in the above matters :
(1) Civil Appeal No. 6814 of 1983 is allowed and the judgment and order appealed against are reversed and set aside and the writ petition filed by the Respondent in the High Court is hereby dismissed.
(2) Writ Petitions Nos. 1953,7393,1392 and 2022 of 1981 are hereby dismissed.
(3) All the remaining Writ Petitions and all the Transferred Cases and Civil Appeals Nos. 3231 of 1981 and 4067 of 1983 are dismissed while Civil Appeals Nos. 3484 and 3512 of 1982 are allowed and the judgments and orders appealed against are reversed and set aside and the writ petitions filed by the Respondents in the High Courts are hereby dismissed. We direct the appellate authority under the Central Industrial Security Force Rules, 1969, to dispose of as expeditiously as possible such appeals of the members of the Central Industrial Security Force as may still be pending. In the case of those government servants in this particular group of matters who have not filed any appeal, in view of the fact that they were relying upon the decision of this Court in Chalappan's case, we give them time till September 30, 1985, to file a departmental appeal, if so advised, and we direct the concerned appellate authority to condone in the exercise of its power under the relevant service rule the delay in filing the appeal and, subject to what is stated in this Judgment under the headings ""Service Rules and the Second Proviso - Challappan's case and ""The Second Proviso - Clause
(b)"", to hear the appeal on merits.
(4) All interim orders made in the above matters are vacated but the government servants will not be liable to refund any amount so far paid to them.
(5) There will be no order as to costs in all the above matters.
(6) All other matters pending in this Court in which a question of the interpretation of the second proviso to clause (2) of Article 311 or of an analogous service rule is involved will stand disposed of in accordance with this Judgment.",Constitutional Case

"K.JAYACHANDRA REDDY, J. This appeal is directed against the order of the Administrative Tribunal, Bangalore dismiss- ing an application filed by the appellant. The principal question involved is whether SubRule (2) of Rule 3 of Karna- taka Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules, 1977 ('General Rules' for short) has the overriding effect over the Karnataka General Service (Motor Vehicles Branch) (Recruitment) Rules, 1976 ('Special Rules' for short). For a better appreciation of the question it becomes necessary to state few facts. The appellant was appointed initially as Inspector of Motor' Vehicle and was promoted as Assistant Regional Transport Officer in the year 1976 in which year the Special Rules were framed. In the year 1981 the appellant was promoted as Regional Trans- port Officer. Some of the General Rules of 1977 were amended in the year 1982 and Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 3 was inserted in the said Rules. In the year 1989 the second respondent was promoted as Deputy Commissioner of Transport on seniority- cure-merit basis alone as purported to have been provided in new Rule 3(2) of General Rules. Being aggrieved by the same the appellant filed an Application No. 3155/89 before the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal questioning the promotion of second respondent on the ground that the promotion to the post of Deputy Commissioner of Transport should be by selec- tion from the cadre of Regional Transport Officers and not merely on seniority-cum-merit basis. His application was dismissed by the Tribunal holding that Rule 3(2) of General Rules which was introduced later overrides the earlier Special Rules. It is this order which is questioned in this appeal.",Civil Case

"We would first set out the facts in brief and so far as relevant for appreciating the issues arising for decision and thereafter deal with the same.

(a)[in respect of lands, other than a tea estate] ten paise on each rupee of the annual value thereof;

(B) Tea matters The writ petitions in which the validity of the levy of cesses relatable to tea estates is involved has an interesting legislative history behind it. By virtue of the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 1981, amendments were effected in the provisions of the West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973, and the West Bengal Rural Employment And Production Act, 1976. Cesses were sought to be levied upon certain lands and buildings in the State for raising funds for the purpose of providing primary education throughout the State and to provide for employment in rural areas. Different rates in respect of lands, coal mines and other mines on annual basis were provided. Tea estates were carved out as a separate category and a separate rate was prescribed therefor as under.

""Section 4(2) : The rural employment cess shall be levied annually -
(a) in respect of lands, other than a tea estate, at the rate of six paise on each rupee of development value thereof;
(aa) in respect of a tea estate at such rate, not exceeding ruppes six on each kilogram of tea on the despatches from such tea estate of tea grown therein, as the State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, fix in this behalf :
Provided that in calculating the despatches of tea for the purpose of levy of rural employment cess, such despatches for sale made at such tea auction centers as may be recognized by the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette shall be excluded:
Provided further that the State Government, may fix different rates on despatches of different classes of tea.
Explanation. - For the purpose of this section, 'tea' means the plant Camelia Sinensis (L) O. Kuntze as well as all varities of the product known commercially as tea made from the leaves of the plant Camelia Sinensis (L) O. Kuntze, including green tea and green tea leaves, processed or unprocessed.""
Relevant Entries and principles of interpretation Before we proceed to examine the merits of the submissions and counter submissions made on behalf the parties, it will be useful to recapitulate and summarise a few principles relevant for interpreting entries classified and grouped into the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The law is legion on the point and the principles which are being briefly stated hereinafter are more than settled. These principles are referred to in the several decisions which we shall be referring to hereinafter. So far as the principles are concerned they have been followed invariably in all the decisions, however diverse results have followed based on facts of individual cases and manner of application of such principles to the facts of those cases.

The scheme of the impugned Orissa Act was examined in- depth and their Lordships found that the cess levied by the impugned Act was a fee. The Act was passed for the purpose of the development of mining areas in the State. Orissa is a poor State carrying in its womb a lot of mineral wealth of great potential value, but the areas where its mineral wealth is located lack infrastructure which would enable the exploitation of minerals. The primary and the principal object of the Act was to develop the mineral areas in the State and to assist more efficient and extended exploitation of its mineral wealth. The cess levied did not become a part of the consolidated fund and was not subject to an appropriation in that behalf ; it went into the special fund earmarked for carrying out the purpose of the Act and thus its existence established a correlation between the cess and the purpose for which it was levied, satisfying the element of quid pro quo in the scheme. The scheme of the Act showed that the cess was levied against the class of persons owning mines in the notified area and to enable the State Government to render specific services to the said class by developing the notified mineral area. Its application was regulated by a statute and was confined to its purposes. There was a definite correlation between the impost and the purpose of the Act which was to render services to the notified area. These features of the Act impressed upon the levy the character of a fee as distinct from a tax.",Constitutional Case

Act was remain with you from 19-08-2000 to 31-01-01, 16-02-01 to 26-0702, 03.12.02 to 12.06.05 and 25.09.05 to 03.04.06 respectively. During their respective tenures, accused Virender s/o Sh. Chattar Singh R/o 81, Old Roshan Pura Najafgarh, New Delhi was not arrested by any of them in stipulated period though-the identity of the accused was never in doubt. As per provisions of section 468 CrPC, the period of limitation for taking cognizance of offence under Section 379 IPC & 39 of the Indian Electricity Act is only three years from the date of offence i.e. 19.08.2000. Accordingly, the limitation period expired on 19.08.2003. The challan of this case was prepared only on 08.06.2005 and was filed in the courts on 03.04.2006. Challan was put in court after almost 3 years, after the expiry of the prescribed time limit. The application before the Honble trial court for condonation of time delay was not forwarded by the appropriate authority. All the above mentioned IOs are responsible for perfunctory investigation for not arresting the accused in time and delay in investigation resulting time barred. Ulterior motive cannot be ruled out. SI Sandeep Sharma is responsible for unnecessary delay for about six months in putting up the case file in the court for trial even after preparation of challan.
The above act on the part of ASI Omparkash No.1631/D (PIS No.28760016), SI Gyanender Rana No.D-3644 (PIS No.16003644), ASI Satbir Singh No.1550/D (PIS No.28750350) and SI Sandeep Sharma No.487/D (PIS No.16970080), amounts to gross misconduct, negligence, which render them liable to be dealt with departmentally under the provision of Delhi Police (Punishment and Appeal) Rules 1980.
4. Both the Charged Officials have preferred appeals against the award of penalty of censure to them to the appellate authority as referred to above. The same, however, did not find favour with the appellate authority. His appeal was accordingly rejected. A copy of the order of the appellate authority is at Annexure A/2.

6. The applicants have taken a number of grounds in their respective Applications in support of their claim, as aforesaid, which can be classified into three categories, viz., (1) those relating to inordinate delay in investigation of the case resulting in the case becoming time barred; (2) those relating to conduct of investigation by them to the best of their abilities and inspite of due diligence and care, they were unable to arrest the accused, and (3) those relating to the applicants being pre-occupied and over-burdened with lot of other cases.",Administrative Case
"2. The OA is filed being aggrieved by the notification dated 05.03.2015 allocating the applicant to the State of Andhra Pradesh instead of being allocated to the State of Telangana.

The applicant opted for Telangana. As per the guidelines dated 22.08.2014, the All India Services officers are broadly bifurcated into three categories i.e., direct recruitee(DR) insider, direct recruitee outsider and promotes (Promotion quota). Againout of the above three categories except promotes, the remaining two categories were sub-divided into four categories based upon their community status i.e. UR, OBC, SC and ST. In as much as there is no reservation in promotions, they have not sub-divided the promotee quota. The applicant is a direct recruitee-UR-outsider. The process of bifurcation starts with calculation of roster size and roster point which has been enumerated in the said guidelines. Para-7 of the guidelines is dealt with the promotion quota and DR insiders. The swapping procedure was permitted if the two officers falling in the same roster opt to shift to other State and if there are more number of options, the senior should be given preference. In short the swapping is allowed for promotion quota and Direct Recruitee insider within one's roster.

8. The issue under dispute is about non-allocation of the applicant to the State of Telangana in the IFS cadre. The brief facts which are important in resolving the dispute are that the composite State of Andhra Pradesh has undergone bifurcation as per the AP Re-organization Act of 2014. Under the Act, the Advisory Committee headed by Sri Pratyush Sinha was formed. The Committee laid down certain guidelines and as per the guidelines, the allocation of the officers of All India Service officers has to be done. The applicant alleges that the guidelines have not been followed and that the allocation was on a selective basis depending upon the chosen officers. The allocation has been done on three occasions and reasons for small changes done in the allocation are not understood. The very basis of creation of Advisory Committee having Sri P.K.Mohanty as a Member of the Committee vitiates the recommendations of the Committee since he has conflict of interest with his daughter and son-in-

inclusion of the name of Dr. P.K. Mohanty (who retired on 01.06.2014 i.e. one day prior to the appointed day)?

40. If persons recruited from different sources are integrated into one class, they cannot thereafter be classified so as to permit in favour of some of them a preferential treatment in relation to others. That is the argument before us which, applied to be facts of the case, means in plain terms this: Direct recruits and promotees having been appointed as Assistant Engineers on equal terms, they constitute an integrated class and for purposes of promotion they cannot be classified on the basis of educational qualifications.",Administrative Case

"5. On show cause notice issued to the applicants and pursuant to their replies resulted in dispensation of their services as a Principal and reversion to the substantive grade of PGTs, the order in the above OA was challenged before the High Court of Delhi by the applicants in C.W.P. No. 29-32 of 2005 in S.K. Sharma and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.. By an order dated 21.5.2005, taking cognizance of the fact that in one of the Miscellaneous Applications the grounds had not been adverted to by the Tribunal, the case was remanded back to the Tribunal for a reasoned finding on the grounds alleged in the MAs as well as in the OA and to determine the status of the applicants whether they were appointed on deputation or were direct appointees. As a result thereof, the interim order had been continued as to the status of the applicants as Principal, giving rise to these OAs.

7. Shri Gupta states that in CWP (Supra) by an order dated 21.05.2005 the finding of the Tribunal as to the status of the applicants as deputatioriists having been set aside, applicants in the matter of regularization as Principal had invidiously been discriminated.

However, simultaneously around 140 PGTs, who had been appointed which included mostly the general category candidates on deputation their deputation has been later on transformed into appointment on regular basis. The respondents have not only dispensed with the services of those PGTs, who had been regularized, but also issued show cause notices to those who had been regularized, which led to spate of litigation before the Tribunal as well as before the High Court in different States.",Administrative Case
"7. In Civil Appeal Nos.3595-3612 of 1999 the respondents therein who were temporarily engaged on daily wages in the Commercial Taxes Department in some of the districts of the State of Karnataka claim that they worked in the department based on such engagement for more than 10 years and hence they are entitled to be made permanent employees of the department, entitled to all the benefits of regular employees. They were engaged for the first time in the years 1985-86 and in the teeth of orders not to make such appointments issued on 3.7.1984. Though the Director of Commercial Taxes recommended that they be absorbed, the Government did not accede to that recommendation. These respondents thereupon approached the Administrative Tribunal in the year 1997 with their claim. The Administrative Tribunal rejected their claim finding that they have not made out a right either to get wages equal to that of others regularly employed or for regularization. Thus, the applications filed were dismissed. The respondents approached the High Court of Karnataka challenging the decision of the Administrative Tribunal. It is seen that the High Court without really coming to grips with the question falling for decision in the light of the findings of the Administrative Tribunal and the decisions of this Court, proceeded to order that they are entitled to wages equal to the salary and allowances that are being paid to the regular employees of their cadre in government service with effect from the dates from which they were respectively appointed. It may be noted that this gave retrospective effect to the judgment of the High Court by more than 12 years. The High Court also issued a command to the State to consider their cases for regularization within a period of four months from the date of receipt of that order. The High Court seems to have proceeded on the basis that, whether they were appointed before 01.07.1984, a situation covered by the decision of this Court in Dharwad District Public Works Department vs. State of Karnataka (1990 (1) SCR 544) and the scheme framed pursuant to the direction thereunder, or subsequently, since they have worked for a period of 10 years, they were entitled to equal pay for equal work from the very inception of their engagement on daily wages and were also entitled to be considered for regularization in their posts.

"BALCO was incorporated in 1965 as a Government of India Undertaking under the Companies Act, 1956. Prior to its disinvestment it had a paid-up share capital of Rs. 488.85 crores which was owned and controlled by the Government of India. The company is engaged in the manufacture of aluminium and had plants at Korba in the State of Chhattisgarh and Bidhanbag in the State of West Bengal. The Company has integrated aluminium manufacturing plant for the manufacture and sale of aluminium metal including wire rods and semi-fabricated products.

The Government of Madhya Pradesh vide its letter dated 18th March, 1968 wrote to BALCO stating that it proposed that land be granted to it on a 99 years lease subject to the terms and conditions contained therein. The letter envisaged giving on lease Government land on payment of premium of Rs. 200/- per acre and, in addition thereto also to provide tenure land which was to be acquired and transferred on lease to BALCO on payment by it the actual cost of acquisition plus annual lease rent. Vide its letter dated 13th June, 1968 BALCO gave its assent to the proposal contained in the aforesaid letter of 18th March, 1968 for transfer of land to it. BALCO intimated by this letter that the total requirement of land would be about 1616 acres. Thereafter, in addition to the Government land which was transferred, the Government of Madhya Pradesh acquired land for BALCO under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 on payment of compensation. The District Collector, Bilaspur also granted permission under Section 165(6) of the M.P. Land Revenue Code, 1959 for acquiring/transferring private land in favour of BALCO. As a result of the aforesaid, BALCO set up it's establishment on it's acquiring land from and with the help of the State Government.

M/s Jardine Fleming, Global Advisor made an analysis of the various bids on the basis of the financial and technical capability, familiarity with India and overall credibility. Thereupon two companies, namely, Indian Minerals Corporation Plc. And Tranex Holding Inc. were rejected. The Inter-Ministerial Group (hereinafter referred to as IMG) set up by the Union of India, accepted the expression of interest of six out of eight parties and it also decided that the bids of Sterlite and MALCO be treated as one. Thus there remained five prospective bidders but two, namely, VAW Aluminium AG, Germany and Sibirsky, Russia dropped out and the remaining three, namely, ALCOA, USA, Hindalco and Sterlite conducted due diligence (inspection) on BALCO between September to December, 2000.

The IMG considered the drafts of the Shareholders' Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement and had discussions with three prospective bidders and ultimately the said drafts were finalised on 11th January, 2001.

For the purpose of carrying out the asset valuation of BALCO, the Global Advisor short listed four parties from the list of Registered Government Valuers approved by the Income-Tax Department. On 18th January, 2001, BALCO invited quotations from the four Registered Valuers, so short listed, and the quotation of Shri P.V. Rao was accepted. Shri P.V. Rao was a registered valuer of immovable property and his team mates were Government Registered Valuers authorised to value plant and machinery. They were assisted in the work of valuation by officers of the Indian Bureau of Mines for assessing the value of existing mines. Pending the receipt of the valuation report from Shri P.V. Rao, the Global Advisor on 8th February, 2001 requested the three bidders to submit their financial bids along with other necessary documents by 15th February, 2001, which was later extended by one day. On 14th February, 2001 Shri P.V. Rao submitted his asset valuation report to M/s Jardine Fleming.

On 15th February, 2001, an Evaluation Committee headed by the Additional Secretary (Mines) was constituted. This Committee was required to fix the reserve price of 51% equity of BALCO which was to be sold to the strategic party. The three contenders, namely, Alcoa, Hindalco and Sterlite Industries Ltd. submitted their sealed bids to the Secretary (Mines) and Secretary (Disinvestment) on 16th February, 2001. It is thereafter, that M/s Jardine Fleming presented its valuation report together with the asset valuation done by Shri P.V. Rao to the Evaluation Committee to work out the reserve price.

When the financial bids were opened, it was found that the bid of Sterlite Industries was the highest at Rs. 551.5 crores, the bid of Hindalco was Rs. 275 crores while ALCOA had opted out. The report of the Evaluation Committee for acceptance of the bid which was higher than the reserve price was considered by the IMG which recommended the acceptance of the bid of Sterlite Industries to the core group of Secretaries. This core group in turn made its recommendation to the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment which on 21st February, 2001 approved/accepted the bid of Sterlite Industries at Rs. 551.5 crores. The Government's decision was communicated to Sterlite Industries on that date. The announcement of the decision to accept the bid of Sterlite Industries led to the initiation of legal proceedings challenging the said decision. On 23rd February, 2001, Dr. B.L. Wadhera filed Civil Writ Petition No. 1262 of 2001 in the Delhi High Court. This was followed by Writ Petition No. 1280 of 2001 filed by the employees of BALCO on 24th February, 2001 also in the High Court of Delhi. On that very date, i.e., on 24th February, 2001 another employee of BALCO, namely, Mr. Samund Singh Kanwar filed Civil Writ Petition No. 241 of 2001 in the High Court of Chhattisgarh.",Constitutional Case
"Brief facts of the case are that Accused No. 2, Somashekhara, Accused No. 8, Thammaiah and PW 8 Krishnaiah were running a Chit Transaction in which successful members were given articles like vessels, watches, sarees, cloth-pieces, etc. The said transaction was conducted once a week in the shop of PW 8 Krishnaiah and also at Kollapuradamma Temple at Hanumanthapura. It is the case of the prosecution that on October 30, 1989, one such transaction was held at about 5.30 p.m. in which one Nagaraj, the successful bidder was given a copper vessel (Kolaga). Nagaraj returned the vessel with his maternal uncle as it was old and demanded a new vessel. But the request was refused by the proprietors of the Chit Transaction. It is further the prosecution case that at about 9.30 p.m. on the same day, i.e. October 30, 1989, near Hanumanthapura Bypass, when PW1 Veerabhadraiah along with PWs 2, 3 and 4 (Chikkanna, Rudramurthy and Puttiah) was proceeding, the Accused Nos. 1 to 8 who had formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and were armed with weapons like, knife, reapers and stones attacked PWs 2 to 4. The accused caused injuries to all the three persons. It is alleged that when the quarrel was going on and PWs 2 to 4 were injured, deceased Anjinappa came forward and intervened and went ahead to stop the quarrel. Accused No. 8 Thammaiah took out a button knife from his pocket and stabbed Anjinappa on the left side of his chest, due to which Anjinappa slumped and fell on the ground. Complainant Veerabhadraiah along with one Krishnaiah, s/o Oblaiah carried Anjinappa in an autorickshaw to the hospital. On the way to hospital, Anjinappa breathed his last. The dead body of Anjinappa was then taken to the General Hospital, Tumkur. The accused persons after committing assault, threw the clubs and rippers at the spot and ran away. At about 11.30 p.m., PW 13 Madhukar Musale, Circle Inspector of Police, Tumkur received an information about the incident of rioting that took place at Hanumanthapura. On being intimated by PSI, PW 7 A.R. Shariff about the rioting and the injured being admitted to General Hospital at Tumkur, PW 13 went to the hospital and learnt that Anjinappa had died and the other three injured persons were taking treatment. It is alleged that PW 1, Veerabhadraiah, who was present in the hospital, was questioned by PW 13. The information given by him was recorded in writing as per Ex. P-1 as complaint and was registered as Crime No. 86 of 1989 for offences punishable Sections 143, 147, 148, 324 and 302 read with Section 149 IPC. Accused No. 7 Tukaraiah died during the pendency of the case and the trial abated against him. Inquest over the dead body of deceased Anjinappa was done and the dead body was sent for post-mortem examination. PW 11 Dr. Hanumakka who conducted the postmortem opined that the injuries were ante mortem in nature. She found a punctured wound over the left 3rd inter costal space extending from medial edge of the areola of left nipple obliquely downwards and medially 2"" x 2"" size with clean cut margin and fat protruding through the wound the depth of which was 3= inches. Likewise, injuries to PWs 2 to 4 were also proved by PW 12, Dr. Chandrasekhara Prasad.

In order to substantiate its case, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses. PWs 1 to 4 were portrayed as eye witnesses and amongst them, PWs 2 to 4 were shown to be injured persons. They supported the case of the prosecution as to Chit Transaction, the incident which took place at about 5.30 p.m. on October 30, 1989 as also the assault at 9.30 p.m. on the same day.

It will, therefore, be proper and appropriate to deal with the relevant facts in civil appeal No. 2876 of 1986 first. The appellant herein--the Delhi Transport Corpora- tion, is a statutory body formed and established under Section 3 of the Delhi Road Transport Act, 1950 read with Delhi Road Transport (Amendment) Act, 1971 (hereinafter called 'the Act'). The appellant carries out the objects of vital public utility, according to the appellant, i.e. transport of passengers in the Union Territory of Delhi and other areas. Respondent No. 2, Sri Ishwar Singh was appoint- ed as conductor therein on probation for a period of 1 year in 1970. The probation period was extended thereafter for a further period of one year and thereafter he was regularised in service of the appellant. Similarly, respondent No. 3--Sri Ram Phal was appointed as Assistant Traffic Incharge and after the probation period he was regularised in serv- ice. Respondent No. 4--Sri Vir Bhan was appointed as driver and after completing the probation period he was also regu- larised in service. It is stated that respondents Nos. 2 to 4 became, according to the appellant, inefficient in their work and started inciting other staff members not to perform their duties. They were served with termination notices on 4th June, 1985 under Regulation 9(b) of the Delhi Road Transport Authority (Conditions of Appointment & Service) Regulations, 1952. On 11th June, 1985 respondents Nos. 2 to 4 and their Union being respondent No. I-DTC Mazdoor Con- gress, filed writ petition No. 1422/85 in Delhi High Court, challenging the constitutional validity of Regulation 9(b) of the Delhi Road Transport Act. On 11th May, 1986 the division bench of the High Court of Delhi allowed the said writ petition and struck down Regulation 9(b) of the said Regulations, and directed the appellant to pay back respondents' wages and benefits within 3 months from the date of the said judgment. This is an appeal, therefrom, by special leave. The question, therefore, is, was the High Court justified in the view it took? It may be mentioned that regulations 9(a) & (b) were framed in exer- cise of the powers conferred u/s 53 of the said Act, which enables the formulation of Regulations. Regulation 9 of the said regulations, which is material for the present contro- versy, reads as follows:

""9. Termination of service: (a) Except as otherwise speci- fied in the appointment orders, the services of an employee of the authority may be terminated without any notice or pay in lieu of notice:
(i) During the period of probation and without assigning any reason thereof.
(ii) For misconduct,
(iii) On the completion of specific period of appointment.
(iv) In the case of employees engaged on contract for a specific period, on the expiration of such period in accord- ance with the terms of appointment.
(b) Where the termination is made due to reduction of estab- lishment or in circumstances other than those mentioned at
(a) above, one month notice or pay in lieu thereof will be given to all categories of employees.
(c) Where a regular/temporary employee wishes to resign from his post under the authority he shall give three/one month's notice in writing or pay in lieu thereof to the Authority provided that in special cases, the General Manager may relax, at his discretion, the conditions regarding the period of notice of resignation or pay in lieu thereof.""
The appellant, however, was continued to be governed by the Statutory Rules, known as District Board Rules, 1926. According to the respondent, the appellant did not cooperate inasmuch as he was not available in the Headquarters and presumably left without permission and without handing over important record and documents of the District Board, etc. But the appellant's version, as stated in the grounds of appeal, was entirely different. He urged that it was on account of vindictive attitude on the part of some of the employees of the respondent, which had produced his termina- tion order without enquiry. The District Board resolved that in terms of condition 4 of the terms of appointment, his services should be terminated on one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof.

The services of the appellant were terminated vide Resolution dated 26th November, 1964 of the Board and he was discharged by allowing him one month's salary in lieu of notice. The termination order was dated 14th December, 1964. The appellant, Shri Satnam Singh filed a suit for declara- tion in the Court of Senior Sub-Judge, Ferozepure, challeng- ing the order of termination dated 14th December, 1964 as illegal, void, ultra vires, etc. The Senior Sub-Judge, Ferozepure, vide judgment and decree dated 9th January, 1969 held that the discharge of the appellant amounted to dismissal and as clearly no enquiry was held against him, the termina- tion simpliciter was bad in law. The respondent, Zila Pari- shad filed an appeal in the Court of 3rd Additional District Judge, Ferozepure, who vide order dated 22nd December, 1969 affirmed the decision of the trial Judge and dismissed the appeal of the respondent. The respondent filed regular appeal in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandi- garh, inter alia, pleading that the appellant was validly discharged in terms of his appointment order and rule 1(i), Part V-A of the District Board Rules, 1926.

The appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1115/76, who appeared in person before us reiterated the relevant facts and urged that his removal was bad and the rule under which he was removed may be quashed. It may be mentioned that as regards letter of Shri Kuldip Singh Virk to the Senior Superintend- ent of Police, Ferozepure regarding the charges of corrup- tion against the appellant, a case under s. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was registered. The appellant was tried for the said alleged offence and acquitted of the charges by the Special Judge Ferozepure. A further case was registered under ss. 381/ 409 of IPC against the appellant. Accordingly, the appellant was tried by the Judicial Magis- trate Ferozepure. The charge was framed by the Judicial Magistrate against the appellant. Against the aforesaid, the appellant filed a petition in the High Court and the charge and the proceedings in question were thereupon quashed by the High Court in July/August, 1967. There were three more cases tried by the Special Judge, Ferozepure and acquitted. The appellant filed a document in this Court claiming the monetary claim on the basis that his termination was wrongful. According to the appellant, he was entitled to recover Rs.4,83,061.90 paise. However. according to the statement filed by Shri Nayar, learned counsel for the respondents in this case, the appellant was entitled to withdraw from the District Board Rs.2,46,464.46 paise, in case he would have been in service before his date of super- annuation, i.e., 30th September, 1984. There is no evidence from either side as to whether the appellant had worked somewhere else though the appellant did not work with the respondent because of his suspension. The appellant had, however, stated that he did not so work. In that view of the matter, if the contentions or' the appellant are accepted that the clause under which the terms of employment of the appellant was agreed and under which the termination was effected without any enquiry and further in view of the fact that the learned trial Judge before whom the appellant had filed the suit first and decreed the suit declaring the appellant to be entitled to be in service, the appellant, in our opinion. should rightly be granted a monetary claim for Rs.4,83,061.90 paise and further interest at 6% from 30th September, 1984. This would be in consonance with justice and equity in the facts and the circumstances of this case. This order, however, will have to be passed if we accept the contention on behalf of the appellant herein on the con- struction of the clause.

In the case of Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v. Malvenkar and Ors., [1978] 3 SCR 1000 the services of respondent No. 2, a permanent clerk in the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking, which is run by the appel- lant were terminated from the close of work on January 23,' 1968 as her record of service was unsatisfactory. The order of termination stated that the respondent No. 2 should be paid one month's wages in lieu of notice and would also be eligible for all the benefits as might be admissible under the Standing Orders and Service Regulations of the Undertaking. The respondent No. 2 made an application before the Labour Court under Section 42(4) of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act contending that the order terminating her services was invalid as it was not passed by the competent authority as envisaged by the Stand- ing Order and that the so called Executive Assistant to the General Manager had no authority to terminate her services because no validly sanctioned post of that designation existed on 20th or 23rd January, 1968. It was also contended that the aforesaid oders besides being mala fide was viola- tive of the principles of natural justice in as much as the same was passed without holding any enquiry. The Labour Court dismissed the application. The respondent's appeal before the President of the Industrial Court was however allowed. The Industrial Court held that the impugned orders bore only the initials of the Central Manager and therefore it was passed by an authority which was lacking in authori- ty, the wording ""unsatisfactory service record"" cast a stigma and was patently punitive attracting the non-observ- ance of Standing Order No. 26 which did not create an abso- lute right in the management to terminate the services of an employee for misconduct without holding an enquiry or giving her a fair opportunity of being heard. A Writ application filed by the appellant was dismissed holding inter alia that the appellant was dismissed holding inter alia that the fact that Standing Order 26 required reasons to be mentioned in the order terminating the services of an employee did not mean that an order of dismissal on the ground of misconduct could be converted into an order of discharge simpliciter by mentioning therein the nature of misconduct. While allowing the appeal on Special Leave it was held by this Court that under Standing Order 26 powers have been given to the Management in a particular case and this ques- tion has to be determined having regard to the substance of the matter and not its form. One is the power of holding disciplinary enquiry under clause (3) of Standing Order 231 read with standing Order 23 and the other is the power to terminate the services of an employee by one calendar month's written notice or pay in lieu thereof under Standing Order 26. The question is as to which power has been exer- cised by the Management in a particular case and this ques- tion has to be determined having regard to the substance of the matter and not its form. There are two distinct and independent powers and as far as possible, neither should be construed so as to emasculate the other or to render it ineffective. One is the power to punish an employee for misconduct while the other is the power to terminate sim- pliciter the service of an employee without any other ad- verse consequences. Proviso (i) to clause (1) of Standing Order 26 requires that the reason for termination of the employment should be given in writing to the employee when exercising the power of termination of services of the employee under Standing Order 26. The Management is required to articulate the reason which operated in its mind for terminating the services of the employee. But merely because the reason must obviously not be arbitrary. capricious or irrelevant, it would not necessarily in every case make the order of termination punitive in character so as to require compliance with the requirements of clause (2) of Standing Order 21 read with Standing Order 23. It was further held that the service of the respondent was not satisfactory was undoubtedly based on past incidents set out in the record but for each of these incidents punishment is one form or another had already been meted out to her and it was not by way of punishment for any of these incidents, but because as gathered from these incidents, her record of service was unsatisfactory that her service was terminated by the man- agement under Standing Order 26. The appellant produced satisfactory evidence to show that the impugned order termi- nating the service of the respondent was justified and hence the impugned order must be sustained despite its having been passed without complying with the requirements of clause (2) of Standing Order 21 read with Standing Order 23. This decision has been made in the special facts and circum- stances in that particular case.

In the case of Manohar P. Kharkhar And Anr. v. Raghuraj & Anr., [1981] 4 LLJ 459 the petitioners challenged the order of termination of services dated 29.4. 1981, under Regulation 48 of Air India Employees' Service Regulations. The petitioner No. 1 was The Director of Engineering and the Head of the Engineering Department while the petitioner No. 2 was Deputy Director of Engineering (Maintenance) and the Head of the Maintenance Division of the Air India Corpora- tion. The Chairman and Managing Director of the said Corpo- ration lost confidence in their ability and suitability to hold such important posts of Head of Departments which were reasonable for maintenance of the Air Crafts, safety of the Air Crafts and safety of the passengers carried therein and the order of termination were based on the note of The Chairman dated 29.4. 1981. Loss of confidence was the result of the negligence and failure to discharge their duty culmi- nating in the admitted sabotage in the case of Makalu, an air craft for the flight of VVIP. On this occasion the petitioners services were terminated on April 29, 1981 by the Chairman who recorded in its record the ground of loss of confidence. This order was challenged as arbitrary and capricious and Regulation 48 was violative of Article 14 of the Constitu- tion as it contained to guidelines for choosing between employees and employees, occasion to occasion for the con- templated action.

Regulation 9(b) empowered the authorities to terminate the service after giving one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof. The order was held to have been made unequivocally in terms of the Regulation 9(h) as the employee was a con- tankerous person and it was desirable to retain him in service. The order was upheld. The question whether Regulation 9(b) was illegal and void as it conferred arbitrary and uncanalised power to terminate the service of a permanent employee without recording any reason and with- out giving any opportunity of hearing before passing the purported order as required under Article 14 of the Consti- tution was neither raised nor considered in this case. In L. Michael & Anr. v. M/s Johnston Pumps India Ltd., (supra) the services of the appellant, an employee of the respondent, were terminated by the latter giving him one month's notice as per. the standing orders without assigning any reasons for the termination. An industrial dispute was referred to the Labour Court. The management alleged that the employee misused his position by passing an important and secret information about affairs of the company to certain outsiders, that even after he was transferred to another section he made attempts to elicit information from the section with a view to pass it on to outsiders, and that therefore, the management lost confidence in the employee and terminated his services by a bona fide order. The Labour Court confirmed the order.",Constitutional Case
"In order to develop a Ghat on the bank of river Ganga near Sapatrishi Ashram in Hardwar, the Sabha issued an advertisement in the newspapers; it invited bids from the eligible civil contractors to construct the Ghat in consideration of 13.5 Bighas (approximately) of its land situated in old Khasra No.140 and new Khasra Nos.61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68 and part of 89, 90 in village Haripur Kalan, Rishikesh, Dehradun out of the total land of 26 Bighas owned by the Sabha. The Ghat was so constructed by one Himmat Rai Ahuja, respondent no.3 herein, on behalf of M/s Ahuja Builders.

On completion of the construction of the Ghat, the Sabha through its President Pt. Mohan Lal Sharma executed a General Power of Attorney on 13.12.1996 in favour of respondent no.3 in regard to the abovementioned land measuring 13.5 Bighas (out of the total of 26 Bighas approximately). On the same date, a receipt of Rs.17,92,000/- lakhs (approximately) was issued by the Sabha to respondent no.3 as an adjustment towards the cost of construction of the Ghat for which the said land of 13.5 Bighas was transferred by executing a General Power of Attorney dated 13.12.1996 in favour of respondent no. 3. On the same day the parties executed an agreement to sell the remaining land situated at Old Khasra No.140 and new Khasra No.89 in Village Haripur Kalan, Rishikesh at the rate of Rs.1,35,000/- per Bigha (which was approx. 11.19 Bighas). In pursuance to this, an earnest money of Rs.4,00,000/- was received by the Sabha from respondent no.3. As per the agreement, respondent no.3 had to pay another Rs.1,00,000/- to the Sabha by 31.1.1997. This amount was paid by respondent no.3 on 21.3.1997 and the balance amount of Rs.10,10,650/- had to be paid by 31.3.1997.

According to the appellants, time was the essence of the contract and respondent no.3 had failed to pay the balance amount by Rs.10,10,650/-. The Sabha had sent a legal notice dated 3.4.1999 (first legal notice) to respondent no.3 to fulfill his contractual obligations under the sale agreement and informing that if he failed to do so, the agreement to sell would stand cancelled and the amount paid as earnest money would be forfeited. In reply to the said notice, respondent no.3 vide his reply dated 5.5.1999 stated that he had not defaulted in payment of the remaining amount. He stated in the reply that as per the agreement the land had to be measured and that he was ready to pay the balance amount once that was done.

Pt. Mohan Lal Sharma, the President of the Sabha, expired on 30.8.1999. On 5.1.2000, both the parties i.e. the representative of the Sabha and the representatives of M/s Ahuja Builders met at the site of the disputed land in the presence of Patwari (Revenue Official). The land of old Khasra No.140 and new Khasra Nos.61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68 and part of 89, 90 was measured by the Patwari. The balance land, after adjusting the land given in lieu of construction of the Ghat, came out to be 11.19 Bighas. The total sale consideration for this land worked out to be Rs.15,10,650/-. Respondent no.3 had already paid Rs.4,00,000/- as earnest money out of this amount. He had paid a further sum of Rs.1,00,000/- on 21.3.1997. On the request of respondent no.3, the Sabha reduced the amount owed of Rs.1,50,000/- to him in view of the existence of a passage on the said land. Out of the balance of Rs.8,60,650/-, a further concession of Rs.60,650/- was given to Respondent no.3. He thus had to pay the balance amount of Rs.8,00,000/-. The said measurement sheet was endorsed by respondent nos.3 and 4 and the representatives of the Sabha on 19.3.2000.

The General Power of Attorney executed by Late Mohan Lal Sharma, President of the Sabha, had ceased to be in effect after his death. Therefore, the need of a fresh power of attorney was felt and respondent no.3 desired that the fresh Power of Attorney be executed in the name of his son, Suresh Ahuja (respondent no.4 herein) for the very same 13.5 Bighas of land in regard to which earlier Power of Attorney dated 13.12.1996 had been given. Accordingly, General Secretary of the Sabha, appellant no.1 herein, executed a fresh General Power of Attorney on 15.1.2000 in respect of 13.5 Bighas of land situated in part of Old Khasra No.140 (new Khasra Nos. 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68 and part of 89, 90) in Village Haripur Kalan, Rishikesh, Dehradun, in favour of Suresh Ahuja (respondent no.4) as per the request of respondent no.3. According to the appellants, the Sabha made several requests to respondent nos.3 and 4 asking them to pay the balance amount of Rs.8,00,000/-. However, despite repeated requests, the respondents failed to do so.

The appellants submitted that the Sabha had learnt from reliable sources and from the office of the Registrar of Properties that respondent no.3, by misrepresentation and by misusing his General Power of Attorney for the 13.5 Bighas of land, was attempting to sell the entire 26 Bighas of the Sabhas land to other parties and was executing sale deeds without any right whatsoever in respect of the remaining 11.19 Bighas. The appellants learnt that respondent no.4 had executed at least 29 registered sale deeds consisting of 13.5 Bighas of land in favour of various parties. The Sabha also discovered that 11.19 Bighas of land, for which there was only an agreement to sell between respondent no.3 and the Sabha, was also sold by respondent no.4 to his father (respondent no.3 herein) by executing three registered sale deeds. Such sales could not give any title to respondent no.3. On 30.4.2001, appellant no.1 sent a legal notice (second notice) to respondent nos.3 and 4 informing them that if the balance amount of Rs.8,00,000/- was not paid, he would have to cancel the General Power of Attorney. No reply to the said notice was received from the respondents nor was Rs.8,00,000/- paid. In these circumstances, appellant no. 1 (I. M. Goswami) cancelled the power of attorney issued in favour of respondent no.4 and informed respondent no. 4 accordingly. A public notice of the same was also published by the Sabha in a local newspaper Amar Ujala, a Hindi daily on 25.10.2002. The notice informed the general public about the cancellation of the General Power of Attorney given to respondent no.4. According to the appellants, in order to protect the interest of the Sabha, the remaining land of 11.19 Bighas of Khasra No.140 was sold to one Sunil Kumar on as is where is basis on 18.12.2002.

Respondent no.3 filed another complaint on the same day, i.e. 23.4.2003, to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Dehradun and got the FIR registered against the appellant and three other persons. The allegation of respondent no.3 was that the appellants in connivance with other persons had sold the part of land situated in Old Khasra No.140 and new Khasra No.89 which had been transferred to them by way of General Power of Attorney. The FIR was registered on 23.4.2003 as Case No.26 of 2003 under sections 420, 467 and 120-B IPC.

On the basis of the FIR registered, the case was investigated by the Sub-Inspector, Raiwala Police Station. Later on the investigation was transferred to Rishikesh Police Station. Thereafter, the investigation was again transferred to Raiwala Police Station and a charge-sheet was filed in the Court of the Special Judicial Magistrate, Rishikesh.

Aggrieved by the filing of the false and incorrect charge- sheet in the court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Rishikesh in Criminal Case No.1728 of 2003 titled State v. Inder Mohan Goswami & Others, the appellants filed a Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.248 of 2003 in the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital under section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing the proceedings against them. The High Court was pleased to pass the interim order on 22.10.2003 staying further proceedings. A reply was filed on behalf of the State by Shri Dinesh Kumar Sharma, SHO, Raiwala Police Station, in which two points were raised:

1. That, appellant no.1 has wrongly cancelled the General Power of Attorney given to respondent no.4; and
2. That, appellant no.1 has wrongly and illegally executed the sale deed of land comprising in and 90) without returning the earnest money of respondent nos.3 and 4.
The High Court by order dated 16.7.2004 dismissed the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. filed by the appellants on the ground that the records show that the allegations in the FIR constitute an offence as alleged by the complainant. The said order is challenged in this appeal by special leave.

The appellants in the rejoinder submitted that the trial court was not justified in taking cognizance of the matter when no prima facie case was made out against the appellants. The trial court gravely erred in not appreciating the complete facts of the case in the proper perspective. The trial court has not properly comprehended the complete investigation reports, which were conducted by two different investigating officers. It was pointed out that it was the respondents who had committed criminal breach by purporting to sell that part of the land for which an agreement to sell was procured, by misusing the Power of Attorney given to them for some other part of the land. Respondent no.4 was clearly guilty of offences under sections 420 and 467 IPC and the appellants had also filed a criminal complaint against respondent nos.3 and 4 before the Special Judicial Magistrate, Rishikesh under sections 120B/467/468/471 IPC. The criminal case was registered as Case No.1306 of 2003 titled as I.M. Goswami v. Suresh Ahuja. The Special Judicial Magistrate vide order dated 12th May, 2005 had issued summons to respondent nos.3 and 4.",Civil Case

The restructuring, will not adversely affect any railway employees in their career progression.",Administrative Case
"4. It is the case of the applicant that his recruitment and service conditions are governed by the Indian Statistical Service Rules, 1961 (referred hereinafter as the Service Rules, 1961) as amended from time to time, and from 09.09.2013 onwards by the Indian Statistical Service Rules, 2013 (referred hereafter as the Service Rules, 2013) which came to substitute the earlier Service Rules 1961. The applicant had joined Respondent Ministry on 04.11.2011 as Deputy Director General. Thereafter, the Respondent Ministry issued impugned communication dated 5.3.2013 making the respondent No. 2 the Accepting Authority in respect of the APARs of the Applicant. The applicant was conveyed adverse entries in his APAR for the year 2011-2012 vide communication dated 16.12.2013 to which he submitted his representation on 24.01.2014 stating, inter alia, that the impugned Memo dated 05.03.2012 had not been communicated to him and it was only through the mechanism of RTI that he came to learn about its contents. The Respondent Ministry forwarded this communication vide its letter dated 24.12.2013 wherein the applicant submitted, on the basis of the factual matrix, that before writing the adverse remarks, no warning had ever been given to him. His principal challenge to the impugned document was purely in a legal framework; the three tier appraisal system was legally not tenable for the reasons that no consultations had been made with the Department of Personnel and Training; the respondent no. 2 had issued the same without having even obtained the approval of the Minister for which he was not competent; and that the format of the APAR form was still structured to a two-tier appraisal system while the Accepting Authority had been hurriedly superimposed impinging upon the timelines provided.

5. We have noted earlier that representation dated 24.01.2013 has been made largely in such factual matrix but chooses to ignore the issue at hand which stands to be decided largely as a question of law. Considering the size of the OA and counter reply filed by the respondents, it is felt that narration of the facts would serve only to add to the bulk of this order without contributing anything to its substance. Hence, we proceed straightway to list the following grounds on which challenge has been made to the 3rd tier into the system of recording of APAR introduced by means of impugned order dated 05.03.2012:-

1. There has been no prior consultation with the DoPT nor does the impugned order have its approval deemed mandatory otherwise.
2. The impugned decision violates Rule 5 of the Indian Statistical Service Rules, 1961 (page 441). There was no provision for Accepting Authority in the Service Rules, 1961. The note for inserting an Accepting Authority was initiated by means of para 5 of note dated 27.01.2012 (page 482) even when the main file was available with the Department (page 481) implying an ulterior motive. The note of the respondent No. 3, one Arvind Kumar, the then Joint Secretary in the Respondent Organization records that a three level appraisal system was prevailing in most of Central Group A Services while ISS traditionally had two tier appraisal system. This was followed at the time of drafting the new APAR format system introduced in 2010. The note further states that in such cases where the Reporting and Reviewing Authorities award varying and contradictory grades, it becomes difficult for the Secretaries or any other Senior Officers to take a synthasised view in absence of any provision to this effect. This makes introduction of the third level in the form of an Accepting Authority necessary.
3. The applicant submits that he is not questioning the three tire System as such, but rather the manner of introduction of the provision of the third tier. He questions that the format of a JS level Officer could not have been approved by another JS level Officer (Page 506). Since the level of Accepting Authority had been hurriedly introduced without having undertaken the due diligence, it suffered many incongruities e.g. there was no column for Accepting Authority (page 508) and the time schedule did not include the Accepting Authority.
4. The introduction of the three tier system is inconsistent with Rule 3(3) of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 read with Rule 2 and 3(3) of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961. Rule 15 of the Service Rule, 1961 provides that in absence of provisions, rules applicable to the Central Service class 1 shall apply. The applicant submits that there is no provision for Accepting Authority in equivalent rules like the Indian Economic Service In para 4.40 of the OA, the applicant has referred to OM dated 14.05.2009 of DOP&T which inter-alia provides as under:-
(i) The existing nomenclature of the Annual Confidential Report will be modified as Annual Performance Assessment Report (APAR).
(ii) The full APAR including the overall grade and assessment of integrity shall be communicated to the concerned officer after the Report is complete with the remarks of the Reviewing officer and the Accepting Authority wherever such system is in vogue. Where Government servant has only one supervisory level above him, as in the case of personal staff attached to officer, such communication shall be made after the reporting officer has completed the performance assessment.  Therefore, the applicant submits that the system of Accepting Authority for APAR would continue where it is already in vogue and nowhere has the DoPT given a carte blanche to the Respondent Ministry to create the system of Accepting Authority where it was not available. Hence, the applicant submits that the introduction of the system of accepting Authority in APAR is illegal and de-hors the instructions of the DOP&T.
5. The applicant further submits that the Ministry is not the sole Authority for taking decisions in such matters. It is to be advised by the Indian Statistical Service Board constituted under Rule 2 (a) of the Service Rules, 1961. Rules 5 of the Service Rules, 2013 provides that Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme implementation shall be controlling Authority of the Service. This Rule further provides that major policy matter like cadre-review, restructuring of cadres, reviewing the roles and function of the cadres/individual officers vis-a-vis other Ministries or Departments or State Governments or Union Territories etc. are to be decided by the cadre controlling Authority in consultation with the Indian Statistical Service Board. The argument of the applicant is that the creation of Accepting Authority in their APAR under reference does not have the mandatory approval of the Ministry of such (independent authority) and hence it is illegal and de-hors the rules [para 4.43 page 34 of the paper book]. For that matter, even the Minister of State in Independent Authority of Statistic Charge cannot take unilateral decisions and has to have the approval of ISS Board mandatorily. This makes entire exercise bad in law, illegal and non-est.
6. The Applicant further alleges malice in law and malice in fact is that he had been intervener in OA No. 653/2010 whereby appointment respondent No. 2 as Chief Statistician of India has been quashed by this Tribunal vide its order dated 20.10.2011. Respondent No. 2 has now introduced himself as responding as Accepting Authority so that he could get even with him by downgrading his APARs. The applicant further submits that the respondent No. 2 had gone to the extent of threatening him personally that he would ensure that he never gets promoted. The applicant further claims that OA 653/2010 was decided quashing the appointment of respondent no.2 mainly on the basis of his arguments. The applicant had also acted as a Caveator before the Honble High Court W. P. (C) No.8124/2011 and CM No. 18278 of 2011.
7. The applicant submits in support of the alternative prayer that the APAR system with Accepting Authority should not be introduced in respect of the Report year 2011-12, the assessing officers must have a minimum period of 90 days to watch the work of officers reported upon. In the instant case when the impugned communication was issued on 05.03.2012, the concerned Accepting Authority would have only 25 days to watch the applicants performance.

In Civil Appeal Nos.3595-3612 of 1999 the respondents therein who were temporarily engaged on daily wages in the Commercial Taxes Department in some of the districts of the State of Karnataka claim that they worked in the department based on such engagement for more than 10 years and hence they are entitled to be made permanent employees of the department, entitled to all the benefits of regular employees. They were engaged for the first time in the years 1985-86 and in the teeth of orders not to make such appointments issued on 3.7.1984. Though the Director of Commercial Taxes recommended that they be absorbed, the Government did not accede to that recommendation. These respondents thereupon approached the Administrative Tribunal in the year 1997 with their claim. The Administrative Tribunal rejected their claim finding that they have not made out a right either to get wages equal to that of others regularly employed or for regularization. Thus, the applications filed were dismissed. The respondents approached the High Court of Karnataka challenging the decision of the Administrative Tribunal. It is seen that the High Court without really coming to grips with the question falling for decision in the light of the findings of the Administrative Tribunal and the decisions of this Court, proceeded to order that they are entitled to wages equal to the salary and allowances that are being paid to the regular employees of their cadre in government service with effect from the dates from which they were respectively appointed. It may be noted that this gave retrospective effect to the judgment of the High Court by more than 12 years. The High Court also issued a command to the State to consider their cases for regularization within a period of four months from the date of receipt of that order. The High Court seems to have proceeded on the basis that, whether they were appointed before 01.07.1984, a situation covered by the decision of this Court in Dharwad District Public Works Department vs. State of Karnataka (1990 (1) SCR 544) and the scheme framed pursuant to the direction thereunder, or subsequently, since they have worked for a period of 10 years, they were entitled to equal pay for equal work from the very inception of their engagement on daily wages and were also entitled to be considered for regularization in their posts.

"Although the record of these Appeals is voluminous, the salient facts lie within a narrow compass. The First Appellant in both these Appeals, namely, the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to in short as ""the Corporation""), was incorporated on February 22, 1967. The majority of the shares of the Corporation were at all times and still are held by the Union of India which is the Second Respondent in these Appeals, and the remaining shares were and are held by the State of West Bengal and the State of Assam. Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1959 (Act No.l of 1956), provides as follows :

""617. Definition of 'Government Company'.- For the purposes of this Act Government company means any company in which not less than fifty-one per cent of the paid-up share capital is held by the Central Government, or by any State Government or Governments, or partly by the Central Government and partly by one or more State Governments and includes a company which is a subsidiary of a Government company as thus defined.""
The above facts and the provisions aforementioned of the Memorandum of Association and the Articles of Association clearly show that not only is the Corporation a Government company of which all the shares were and are owned by the Central Government and two State Governments but is a Government company which is under the complete control and management of the Central Government.

A company called the ""Rivers Steam Navigation Company Limited"" was carrying on very much the same business including the maintenance and running of river service as the Corporation is doing. A Scheme of Arrangement was entered into between the said company and the Corporation. The Calcutta High Court by its order dated May 5, 1967, approved the said Scheme of Arrangement and order the closure of the said Company and further directed that upon payment to all the creditors of the said Company, the said Company would stand dissolved without winding up by an order to be obtained from the High Court and accordingly, upon payment to all the creditors, the said Company was ordered to be dissolved. The said Scheme of Arrangement provided that the assets and certain liabilities of the said Company would be taken over by the Corporation. The said Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the High Court also provided as follows :

""a) That the new Company shall take as many of the existing staff or labour as possible and as can be reasonably taken over by the said transferee Company subject to any valid objection to any individual employee or employees.
b) That as to exactly how many can be employed it is left to the said transferee Company's bona fide discretion.
c) That those employees who cannot be taken over shall be paid by the transferor Company all moneys due to them under the law and all legitimate and legal compensations payable to them either under Industrial Disputes Act or otherwise legally admissible and that such moneys shall be provided by the Government of India to the existing transferor Company who will pay these dues.""
The First Respondent in Civil Appeal No. 4412 of 1985, Brojo Nath Ganguly, was, at the date when the said Scheme of Arrangement became effective, working in the said Company and his services were taken over by the Corporation and he was appointed on September 8, 1967, as a Deputy Chief Accounts Officer. The First Respondent in Civil Appeal No. 4413 of 1985, Tarun Kanti Sengupta, was also working in the said Company and his services were also taken over by the Corporation and he was appointed on September 8, 1967, as Chief Engineer on the ship ""River Ganga"". It is unnecessary to refer at this stage to the terms and conditions of the letters of appointment issued to these two Respondents as they have been subsequently superseded by service rules framed by the Corporation except to state that under the said letters of appointment the age of superannuation was fifty-five years unless the Corporation agreed to retain them beyond this period. The said letters of appointment also provided that these Respondents would be subject to the service rules and regulations including the conduct rules. Service rules were framed by the Corporation for the first time in 1970 and were replaced by new rules in 1979.

So far as Sengupta, the First Respondent in Civil Appeal No. 4413 of 1985, is concerned, he was promoted to the post of General Manager (River Services) with effect from January 1, 1980. His name was enrolled by the Bureau of Public Enterprises and he was called for an interview for the post of Chairman-cum-Director of the Corporation by the Public Enterprises Selection Board. According to Sengupta, he could not appear before the Selection Board as he received the letter calling him for the interview after the date fixed in D that behalf. According to Sengupta, the new Chairman-cum-Managing Director who was selected at the said interview bore a grudge against him for having competed against him for the said post and on February 1, 1983, he issued a charge-sheet against Sengupta intimating to him that a disciplinary inquiry was proposed to be held against him under the said Rules and calling upon him to file his written statement of defence. By his letter dated February 10, 1983, addressed to the Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Sengupta denied the charges made against him and asked for inspection of documents and copies of statements of witnesses mentioned in the said charge-sheet. By a letter dated February 26, 1983, signed by the Chairman-cum-Managing Director notice was given to Sengupta under clause (i) of Rule 9 of the said Rule, terminating his service with the Corporation with immediate effect. Along with the said letter a cheque for three months' basic pay and dearness allowance in lieu of notice was enclosed. G Both Ganguly and Sengupta filed writ petitions in Calcutta High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the termination of their service as also the validity of the said Rule 9(i). In both these writ petitions rule nisi was issued and an ex parte interim order staying the operation of the said notice of termination was passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court. The Appellants before us went in Letters Patent Appeal before a Division Bench of the said High Court against the said ad interim orders, the appeal in the case of Ganguly being F.M.A.T. No. 1604 of 1983 and in the case of Sengupta being F.M.A.T. No. 649 of 1983. On January 28, 1985, the Division Bench ordered in both these Appeals that the said writ petitions should stand transferred to and heard by it along with the said appeals. The said appeals and writ petitions were thereupon heard together and by a common judgment delivered on August 9, 1985, the Division Bench held that the Corporation was a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and that the said Rule 9(i) was ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution. Consequently the Division Bench struck down the said Rule 9(i) as being void. It also quashed the impugned orders of termination dated February 26, 1983. It is against the said judgment and orders of the Calcutta High Court that the present Appeals by Special Leave have been filed.

The framers of our Constitution did not, however, want to frame for the Sovereign Democratic Republic which was to emerge from their labours a Constitution in the strict legal sense. They were aware that there were other Constitutions which had given expression to certain ideals as the goal towards which the country should strive and which had defined the principles considered fundamental to the governance of the country. They were aware of the events that had culminated in the Charter of the United Nations. They were aware that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had been adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, for India was a signatory to it. They were aware that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contained certain basic and fundamental rights appertaining to all men. They were aware that these rights were born of the philosophical speculations of the Greek and Roman Stoics and nurtured by the jurists of ancient Rome. They were aware that these rights had found expression in a limited form in the accords entered into between the rulers and their powerful nobles, as for instance, the accord of 1188 entered into between King Alfonso IX and the Cortes of Leon, the Magna Carta of 1215 wrested from King John of England by his barons on the Meadow of Runnymede and to which he was compelled to affix his Great Seal on a small island in the Thames in Buckinghamshire - still called Magna Carta Island, and the guarantees which King Andrew II of Hungary was forced to give by his Golden Bull of 1822. They were aware of the international treaties of the midseventeenth century for safeguarding the right of religious freedom and the rights of aliens. They were aware of the full blossoming of the concept of Human Rights in the writings of the ""philosophes"" such as Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Rayal, d'Alembert and others, and of the concrete expression given to it in the various Declarations of Rights of the American Colonies (particularly Virginia) and in the American Declaration of Independence. They were aware that in 1789, during the early years of the French Revolution, the French National Assembly had in ""The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen"" proclaimed these rights in lofty words and that Revolutionary France had translated them into practice with bloody deeds. They were aware of the treaties entered into between various States in the nineteenth century providing protection for religious and other minorities. They were aware that these rights had at last found universal recognition in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They were aware that the first ten Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America contained certain rights akin to Human Rights. They knew that the Constitution of Eire contained a chapter headed ""Fundamental Rights"" and another headed ""Directive Principles of State Policy"". They were aware that the Constitution of Japan also contained a chapter headed ""Rights and Duties of the People"". They were aware that the major traditional functions of the State have been the defence of its territory and its inhabitants against external aggression, the maintenance of law and order; the administration of justice, the levying of taxes and the collection of revenue. They were also aware that increasingly, and particularly in modern times, several States have assumed numerous and wide ranging functions, especially in the fields of education, health, social security, control and maintenance of natural resources and natural assets, transport and communication services and operation of certain industries considered basic to the economy and growth of the nation. They were also aware that section 8 of Article 1 of the Constitution of the United States of America contained ""a welfare clause"" empowering the federal government to enact laws for the overall general welfare of the people. They were aware that countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany had passed social welfare legislation.",Civil Case

"Considering the importance of the issue raised in the letter being concerned by frequent complaints regarding custodial violence and deaths in police lock up, the letter was treated as a writ petition and notice was issued on 9.2.1987 to the respondents.

In response to the notice, the State of West Bengal filed a counter. It was maintained that the police was no hushing up any matter of lock-up death and that whereever police personnel were found to be responsible for such death, action was being initiated against them. The respondents characterised the writ petition as misconceived, misleading and untenable in law.

While the writ petition was under consideration a letter addressed by Shri Ashok Kumar Johri on 29.7.87 to the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India drawing the attention of this Court to the death of one Mahesh Bihari of Pilkhana, Aligarh in police custody was received. That letter was also treated as a writ petition and was directed to be listed alongwith the writ petition filed by Shri D.K. Basu. On 14.8.1987 this Court made the following order :

""In almost every states there are allegations and these allegations are now increasing in frequency of deaths in custody described generally by newspapers as lock-up deaths. At present there does not appear to be any machinery to effectively deal with such allegations.

3. In this appeal, the assessee challenges respective order of the Revenue authorities below on the following grounds:

""1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A) erred in confirming addition of Rs. 1,92,04,765 from out of total addition of Rs.1,93,56,012 made by the Assessing Officer on the basis of the order u/s. 92CA(1) passed by the Transfer Pricing Officer.
2. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A) erred in confirming disallowance of Rs.3,33,478 made by the Assessing Officer in respect of Employees' Contributions to ESI on the ground that the same was not paid within the prescribed time limit under the ESI Act even though the payment was made within the time limit for filing the return of income u/s. 139(1) of the Income-tax Act.
3. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A) erred in rejecting the appellant company's relevant ground of appeal that from out of the total development cost incurred by the appellant company for the products to be sold in domestic as well as international market, only the portion of development cost pertaining to the products to be sold in domestic market should be allocated to Baddi Unit for the purposes of Section 80-IC as the said unit is solely engaged in the manufacturing products to be sold in the domestic market, in spite of the fact that the appellant company wrongly considered total development cost for allocating to Baddi unit while filing the return of income.
4. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A) erred in rejecting the relevant ground of appeal raised by the appellant company before him that while computing deduction u/s. 80-IC of the Income- tax Act the Assessing Officer wrongly reduced the quantum of eligible income by reallocating administrative expenses of Rs. 3,75,57,364 to Baddi unit.
5. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A) erred in rejecting the relevant ground of appeal raised by the appellant company before him that while computing deduction u/s. 80-IC of the Income- tax Act the Assessing Officer wrongly reduced the quantum of eligible income to the following extent:
(a) Excluding Miscellaneous income being penalty recovered from suppliers 5,13,647
(b) Excluding other income 1,05,607
(c) Excluding export income 40,44,949 ITA.Nos.1285/Ahd/2017 & 7 others A.Y.2009-10
6. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned CIT(A) erred in upholding the Assessing Officer's finding that deduction admissible u/s.
4. Briefly, we would take note of facts of the case of the assessee. The assessee company is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. It filed its return of income on 29-9-2009 declaring total income at NIL under normal provisions of the Act. Thereafter, under scrutiny assessment several additions and/or disallowances were made. Upon determination of the total income of the assessee at Rs. 30,74,68,950/- an appeal was preferred by the assessee against the said order before the first appellate authority. The ld. CIT(A) vide order dated 21.3.2017 partly allowed the appeal filed by the assessee against the said assessment order. Being aggrieved by order of the ld. CIT(A), both the assessee and Revenue are before us with respective grievance.

7. During the course of assessment proceedings, the issue was referred to the TPO, who vide his order dated 29.1.2013 read with subsequent order dated 22.3.2013 passed under section 154 of the Act made the following adjustment on account of Arm's Length Price (ALP) in respect of international transactions as detailed below:

       1)    Interest on   loans   to Associate 1,37,31,228/-
             Enterprises

       2)    Guaranty fee charges in respect of Rs.54,73,537/-
             Associate Enterprises

       3)    Fees paid to Associate Enterprises Rs.1,51,247
             for Liaison Services

             Total                               Rs.1,93,56,012/-



8.3. However, such contentions were not acceptable to the ld. TPO. He rejected the claim of the assessee by making upward adjustment of Rs. 54,73,537/-. The observations of the ld. TPO, in this behalf read as under:

""7.5 The various submissions made by the assessee have been considered. A guarantee is a legally enforceable agreement that intends to survive the insolvency of the person or concern on whose behalf it is issued and obliges the guarantor to provide for payment if that person or concern fails to. In case the guarantee is valid, unconditional and irrevocable and it requires prompt payment in full before pursuit of remedies, in principle it provides full credit substitution. If sufficient funding is not provided by the parent company for some reason, subsidiaries that attract funding from third parties are necessarily required to arrange additional collateral from related (parent) company in the form of guarantees. At the same time, guarantees are also being used, at the option of the borrower, to obtain better conditions, notably interest rates, on external financial transactions, creating a benefit on a group -wide basis. 7.6. The claim of the assessee that the guarantee has been provided for working capital and financial needs of the AE and hence it should be treated as implicit parent support and hence the guarantee needs to be benchmarked at ITA.Nos.1285/Ahd/2017 & 7 others A.Y.2009-10 nil is not found an acceptable argument. For an arm's length study, the parent- subsidiary obligation needs to be set aside and it needs to be determined as to what would be the behavior of an independent party in the same scenario. The plea of implicit support would need to be discarded. Once it is acknowledged that a service has been rendered (as it has been done in this case -as the guarantee enables the AE to handle its finances more efficiently), then the service needs to be benchmarked.
7.7 The assessee has contended that providing guarantee is a more efficient way of providing support to the AE as this does not involve any liquid fund outflow and enables the AE handle its financials. The company being the sole shareholder benefits as by providing guarantees, it is prevented from investing in equity. The contention is not found acceptable. A transaction has to be identified by what it actually is - rather than what it could have been. In the case of Perot Systems TSI Vs. DCIT (ITAT Delhi) the assessee, an Indian company, advanced interest free loans to its 100% foreign subsidiaries. The subsidiaries used those funds to rnake investments in other step-down subsidiaries. On the question whether notional interest on the said loans could be assessed in the hands of the assessee under the transfer pricing provisions of Chapter X, the assessee argued that the said ""loans"" were in fact ""quasi- equity"" and made out of commercial expediency. It was also argued that notional income could not be assessed to tax, HELD rejecting both arguments:
(i)) The argument that the loans were In reality not loans but were quasi-capital cannot be accepted because the agreements show them to be loans and there is no special feature in the contract to treat them otherwise.
(iv) The result of the transaction was that the income of the assessee in India would reduce while that of the AE would increase. This was a classic case of violation of transfer pricing norm where profits were shifted to low tax jurisdiction to bring down the aggregate tax incidence of a multinational group.

7.14 The assessee has submitted a working sheet with guarantee working at Euro 26,693/- @ 1%. At 3%, this amount comes to Euro 80081 @ 68.35 comes to 5473537/- .""

12.6. The next aspects arises for the determination of the benchmarked for working out the ALP of the impugned international transaction. The TPO/AO in the case on hand has adopted US bond data for working out the ALP by using the data of bond obtained from the finance yahoo.com by observing as under:

7.12 In light of the discussion above, no case is made to alter the charge of guarantee as per the process described in the show cause notice. An attempt has been made to analyze the bond data in US market to arrive at various levels of yields for differently rated bonds in a global scenario since the U5J bond market is a mature one and is freely traded globally. The coupon rate represents yield on various bonds and the rare is directly proportional 10 the rating given to the bond. Higher the risk of default by the issuing company on this bond, higher the coupon rate. .Details of these bonds are available on the web. The details of such corporate bonds available on www.finanace.yahoo.com (publicly available) was gathered. On analysis of over 1100 bond data, from where the bonds issued during the FY 2008-03 were segregated, it is seen that the difference in coupon rate (yield or interest rate) in respect of AA rated bonds and BB rated bonds comes to 2.706 % age points. A copy of the data mentioned above is supplied to you in a CO. By taking guarantee for payments on behalf of its AE, the assessee has incurred significant currency risk by general depreciation of rupee against dollar. In order to factor this currency risk, the above spread is increased to 3% which is found to be reasonable spread which the assessee should have charged granted to the AE.
12.7. However we find that Bombay high court in case of CIT vs. Everest Kento Cylinders Ltd reported in 58 taxmann.com 254 held that while determining the ALP the rate charge by the bank or financial institution cannot be taken as comparable. The relevant finding of the Hon'ble bench reads as under:
In the present case, it is assessee-company that is issuing corporate guarantee to the effect that if the subsidiary AE does not repay loan availed of it from ICICI, then in such event, the assessee would make good the amount and repay the loan. The considerations which apply for issuance of a corporate guarantee are distinct and separate from that of bank guarantee and, accordingly, commission charged cannot be called in question, in the manner TPO has done. The comparison is not as between like transactions but the comparisons are between guarantees issued by the commercial banks as against a corporate Guarantee issued by holding company for the benefit of its ITA.Nos.1285/Ahd/2017 & 7 others A.Y.2009-10 AE, a subsidiary company. In view of the above discussion, appeal does not raise any substantial question of law and it is dismissed 12.8. Now question arose what should be the ALP rate of the commission on corporate guarantee? In this regard we find that The Tribunal in several cases has considered 0.50% (of corporate guarantee given) as ALP rate of Corporate Guarantee commission. Some of these cases are as under:
(i) Videocon Industries Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2017] 79 taxmann.com 216 (Mumbai -
Trib.), Parent company charged commission at 0.25 %. The ALP was determined by the Tribunal at 0.50%.

14. The aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to Ld. CIT (A) who confirmed the order of the AO/TPO by observing as under:

The appellant had given inter-corporate loan to its associate enterprise in foreign countries and had charged interest at the rate of LIBOR + 100 BP from its associate enterprises. It is stated that the loan advanced to the associate enterprise which is mainly subsidiaries is for advancing appellant's own business interest and it supports the business of the appellant in creating market. Il is further stated that the appellant has not incurred any loss or shifted any profit by advancing1 loan. It has been getting loan at the rate of LIBOR + 62.5 basis and is charging interest at LIBOR + 100 basis. Thus, it has not incurred any loss or transferred any profit. It is also argued that on account of conversion rate having been changed from the date of advancing loan and as on the close of the year it has earned foreign exchange gain on substantial basis. Therefore, there is no loss of revenue and hence the adjustment made is not justified.
The claim of the appellant is that the motive is not to earn the interest income but to run the business through AE smoothly. Further, the appellant has not disclosed lesser tax and has not shifted any profit outside India. The claim of the appellant is not acceptable. Had the purpose of giving the money been to further the interest of the business, the appellant could have easily given the money as share capital and not as loan. Once the amount has been given as loan and has .been shown in the balance sheet as such the appellant should charge market rate of interest at Arm's Length Price. The basic principle of determining the Arm's Length Price is by assuming that the transaction has taken place between unrelated parties. Therefore, the reasoning given by the appellant is not acceptable. The TPO has given detailed justification while adopting the Arm's! Length interest rate which should have been charged by the appellant from the AE. I am in complete agreement with the finding given by him and no interference is required in the order of the TPO. The CIT(A} has taken the same view and confirmed the addition made by the AO on similar facts in AY 2008-09 and 1 find no reason to differ. The adjustment on account of interest at LIBOR + 4.48 basis point is accordingly upheld. The ground of appeal is accordingly dismissed.
The issue in the instant case relates to the determination of ALP of the interest amount on loan given by the assessee to its AE's. The first contention of ld. AR of the assessee before us is that in the given facts, it would be appropriate to accept internal CUP method, i.e., the rate at which the assessee had obtained foreign exchange borrowings at arm's length price under CUP method.

53.9 Now the second controversy arises about the basis of charging .50% margin from the AE. Regarding this, we note that the assessee is charging margin at 37.50 bps from the AE which appears quite low as even the bank charges from the company having high net worth a margin of .50%. Therefore we are inclined to uphold the finding of the TPO for charging the margin at .50% over and above the 6 month average labor rate. In effect, the rate of interest charged by the assessee from the AE shall increase by 12.5 bps. Thus the ground of appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.

24. During the course of assessment proceedings, upon verification of the details filed by the assessee, it was found by the AO that the assessee did not allocate R&D expenditure relating to discovery and research expenditure while computing profit eligible under section 80-IC in respect of Baddi Unit, whereupon explanation was sought from the assessee as to why the same should not be allocated to Baddi Unit. In reply whereof, the assessee submitted the following:

""Your honour have observed that the as$essee company has not allocated R & D cost relating to discovery and R & D capital expenditure, white computation of profit eligible for deduction ii/s, 801C in respect of Baddi unit.

During the period under consideration, the assessee company has claimed weighted deduction @150% of Rs. I,58,72,70,461/-, on revenue spend ofRs.105,81,80,307/-. Of this the Development cost amounts to Rs 65,80,09,561/-. Out of this development cost Rs. 33,92,52,691 /- has been allocated to Baddi unit the basis of turnover, being 51.56% of total turnover ofBaddi and Indra Unit, excluding Insulin sates.
The deduction under section 80IC has to be computed as if such eligible business was the only source of income of the assesses. This follows from the provisions of section 8010(7), which stipulates that the provisions of section 801A (5) and sub section (7) to (12) shall apply to section 80IC (is well Section 80IA(5) is reproduced for ready reference.
""(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act, the profits and gains of an eligible business to which the provisions of sub-section (1) apply shall, for the purposes of determining the quantum of deduction under that sub-section for the assessment year immediately succeeding the initial assessment year or any subsequent assessment year, be computed as if such eligible business were the only source of income of the assessee during the previous year relevant to the initial assessment year and to every subseqitent assessment year up to and including the assessment year for which the determination is to be made.""
27. During the assessment proceedings, it is found that the assessee allocated common administrative expenses on the basis of number of employees of Indrad and Baddi units. However, according to the ld.AO, the same was not found suitable, rather allocation on the basis of turnover of the respective units was found to be fit by the ld.AO, as a result whereof, deduction under section 80IC was reduced by Rs. 3,75,57,364/- which was in turn confirmed by the ld.CIT(A). Hence, aggrieved by this action of both the authorities, the assessee is before us.

28.1. The reply of the assessee was not found suitable, rather size of the company, which can be measured by the turnover of the company should be the mode of allocation for such expenses, as found to be the view of the ld.AO. On the basis of the turnover, the said allocation has been worked out to 51.56% of the total administrative expenses, accordingly, additional amount of Rs. 3,75,57,364 (Rs.16,73,68,858/- minus Rs.12,98,11,494/-) has been allocated by the ld. AO resulting into reduction in the deduction to the tune of Rs. 3,75,57,364/- under section 80IC of the Act was made, which was in turn confirmed by the ld.CIT(A) by following order of his predecessor passed in the assessee's own case for the Asstt.Year 2007-08.

38. For claiming garden expense as revenue expenditure, the explanation of the assessee was that the said expenditure was required to be incurred regularly for gardening inside the factory premise as per the requirement of Gujarat Pollution Control Board, in order to minimize the effect of pollution arising out of chemical process, and therefore, the same is an allowable deduction. However, the AO was of the view that since the assessee has incurred substantial expense in this behalf, the same has resulted in enduring benefit to the assessee, and therefore, expenditure was of capital nature. Accordingly, he disallowed the claim of the assessee. However, the ld. CIT(A) deleted the disallowance made by the AO by observing that in the assessee's own case from the Assessment Year 2003-2004 to 2008-09, the impugned claim allowed consistently right up-to the Tribunal. As such, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal of the Revenue. Accordingly, the ld. CIT(A) has allowed claim of the assessee, and deleted the impugned disallowance. Revenue is therefore in an appeal before the Tribunal.

44. The assessee during the year under consideration claimed deduction under section 35(2AB) of the Act for Rs. 168,84,25,897/- only. The AO from the details in form 3CL found that there were certain expenses amounting to Rs. 218. 31 Lacs which has not been approved by the DSIR. Similarly, an amount of Rs. 1351.45 Lacs has been approved by DSIR as incurred outside the approved facility. Thus, the AO purposed to disallow the claim of weighted deduction on the same.

52. The assessee in the books of account recorded computer software under intangible assets but in computation of income clubbed the same with the block of computer and claimed depreciation on the same @ 60%. On question by the AO, the assessee submitted that as per the requirement of As-26 it disclosed the computer software separately as intangible assets. However as per the note 7 to depreciation schedule under the Act, the software is included in the computer. Thus, it claimed deprecation @ 60% on the same under the block of computer.

63. The assessee during the year received subsidy from central government for Rs. 30 Lacs under Capital Investment Scheme 2003 for its unit situated at Baddi Himachal Pradesh, which has been treated as capital receipt. The AO was of the view that the block assets should be reduced by the amount of the subsidy. Accordingly the AO show caused the assessee.

6,2.5 As regards the disallowance of Rs.2,52 99,20S/-on account of business advancement expenses, it is seen from the details filed that the expenditure has been incurved on the distribution of gift items of various kinds to various stakeholders, like distributors, stockiest, wholesalers, employees, pharmacies, etc. In view of various case laws in this regard, eg AC1T Vs M/s Dupen Laboratories Pvt Ltd, in !TA No 5195/Mum/2013 and ACIT Vs. M/s Liva Healthcare Lld in ITA No.847/Mum/2012 and the facts of the case, it. is held that these expenses are essential for the business of the appellant and pertain wholly and exclusively to its business. The addition of Rs.2,52,99,208/- Is deleted. Ground of appeal No 3 is partly allowed.",Administrative Case

Taking advantage of the said observations of this Court the respondent-accused herein made another application for grant of bail on 5-11-2001 which was the sixth application for bail, said application came to be dismissed by the High Court.

"The conspectus of facts The historic elections to Parliament, recently held across the ,country, included a constituency in Punjab called 13- Ferozepore Parliamentary constituency. It consisted of nine assembly segments and the polling took place on March 16, 1977. According to the calendar notified by the Election Commission, the counting took place in respect of five assembly segments on March 20, 1977 and the, remaining four on the next day. The appellant and the third respondent were the principal contestants. It is stated by the appellant that when counting in all the assembly segments was completed at the respective segment headquarters, copies of the results were given to the candidates and the local tally telephonically communicated to the returning officer (respondent 2). According to the scheme the postal ballots are to arrive at the returning officer's headquarters at Ferozepore where they are to be counted. The final tally is made when the ballot boxes and the returns duly reach the Ferozepore headquarters front the various segment headquarters. The poll proceeded as ordained, almost to the very last stages, but the completion of the counting at the constituency headquarters in Ferozepore was aborted at the final hour as the postal ballots were being counted-thanks to mob violence allegedly mobilised at the instance of the third respondent., The appellant's version is that he had all but won on the total count by a margin of nearly 2000 votes when the panicked opposite party havoced and halted the consummation by muscle tactics. The postal ballot papers were destroyed. The, ballot boxes from the Fazilka segment were also done away with en route, and the returning officer was terrified into postponing the declaration of the result. On account of an earlier complaint that the returning officer was a relation of the appellant, the Election Commission (hereinafter referred to as Commission) had: deputed an officer of the Commission-Shri IKK Menon-as observer of the poll process in the constituency. He was present as the returning officer who under compulsion had postponed the concluding 3 p.m. onwards. Thus the returning officer had the company of the observer with him during the crucial stages and controversial eruptions in the afternoon of March 21. Shortly after sunset, presumably, the returning officer who under compulsion had postponed the concluding part of the election, reported the happenings by wireless massage to the Election Commission. The observer also reached Delhi and gave a written account and perhaps an oral narration of the untoward events which marred what would otherwise have been a smooth finish Lo, the election.

Disturbed by the disruption of the declaratory part of the election, the appellant, along with a former Minister of the State, met the Chief Election Commissioner (i.e. the Commission) at about 10.30 A.M. on March 22nd, with the request that he should direct the returning officer to declare the result of the election. Later in the day, the Commission issued an order which has been characterised by the appellant as a law-less and precedentless cancellation, of the whole poll, acting by hasty hunch and without rational appraisal of facts. By the 22nd of_March, when the Election Commission made the impugned order, the bulk of the electoral results in the country bad beamed in. The gravamen of the grievance of the appellant is that while he had, in all probability, won the poll, he has been deprived of this valuable and hard-won victory by the arbitrary action of the Commission going contrary to fairplay and in negation of the basic canons of natural justice. Of course the Commission did not stop with the cancellation but followed it up a few days later with a direction to hold a fresh poll_for the whole constituency, involving all the nine segments, although there were no complaints about the polling in any of the constituencies and the ballot papers of eight constituencies were available intact with the returning officer and only Fazilka segment ballot papers were destroyed or demanded on the way, (plus the postal ballots). It must also, be mentioned here that a demand was made, according to the version, of the third respondent, for recount in one segment which was,, unreasonably, turned down. The observer, in his report to the Election Commission, also mentioned that in two polling stations divergent practices were adopted in regard to testing valid and invalid votes. To be more pracise, Shri IKK Menon mentioned' in his report that at polling station no. 8, the presiding officer's seal on the tag as well as the paper seal of one box was broken. But the ballot papers contained in that box were below 300 and would not have affected the result in the normal course. In another case in Jalalabad assembly segment, the assistant returning officer had rejected a number of ballot papers of a polling station on the score that they were not signed by the presiding officer. In yet another case it was reported that the ballot papers were neither signed nor stamped but were accepted by the assistant returning officer as valid, al- though the factum was not varified by Shri Menon with the assistant returning officer. Shri Menon, in his report, seems to have broadly authenticated the story of the mob creating a tense situation leading to the military being summoned. According to him only the ballot papers of Fazilka assembly segment were destroyed, not of the. other segments. Even regarding Fazilka, the result-sheet had arrived. So, far as Zira assembly segment was concerned, some documents (not the, ballot papers) had been snatched away by hooligans. The observer had asked the returning officer to send a detailed report over and above the wireless message. That report, dated March 21, reached the Commission on March 23, but, without waiting for the, report we need not probe the reasons for the hurry-the Commission issued the order cancelling the poll. The Chief Election Commissioner has filed a laconic affidavit leaving to the Secretary of the Commission to go into the details of the facts, although the Chief Election Commissioner must himself have had them within his personal ken. This aspect also need not be examined by us and indeed cannot be, for reasons which we will presently set out.

Meanwhile, pursuant to the, Commission's direction, a re- poll was held. Although the appellant's name lingered on the ballot he did not participate in the re-poll and respondent 3 won by an easy plurality although numerically those who voted were less than half of the, previous poll. Of course, if the Commission's order for re-poll fails in law, the second electoral exercise has to be dismissed as a stultifying futility. Two things fall to be mentioned at this stage, but, in passing, it may be stated that the third respondent had complained to the Chief Election Commissioner that the assistant returning officer of Fazilka segment had declined the request for recount unreasonably and that an order for re-poll of the Fazilka assembly part should be made 'after giving personal hearing'. Meanwhile, runs the request of the third respondents 'direct the returning officer to withhold declaration of result of 13 Ferozepore parliament constituency'. We do not stop to make inference from this document but refer to it as a material factor which may be considered by the tribunal which, eventually, has to decide, the factual controversy.

A short description of the legislative project in some more detail may be pertinent, especially touching on the polling process in the booths and the transmission of ballot boxes from the polling stations to the returning officer's ultimate counting station and the crucial prescriptions regarding annuoncements and recounts and declarations. We do not pronounce upon the issues regarding the stage for and right of recount. the validity of votes or other factual or legal disputes since they fall for decision by the Election Court where the appellant has filed an election petition by way of abundant caution.",Civil Case
"V. In the result, we hold as under:

4. For determination of the issue involved in these appeals, it is necessary to discuss the relevant facts as were pleaded by the parties before the Consumer Fora. The same is mentioned hereunder:

5. Case of Anis Ahmad, Anis Ahmed filed a complaint before the District Consumer Protection Forum, Moradabad and claimed that he is a consumer of electricity having connection No.104427 with sanctioned load of 6.5 horse power. He alleged that the authorities of the U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. prepared a fictitious checking report dated 17th July, 2003 and falsely implicated the complainant that he had used more than sanctioned load of 10 H.P. in his factory and on the basis of fictitious report a proceeding was initiated on 15th April, 2004 followed by a bill No.5004369 dated 15th June, 2004 demanding a sum of Rs.2,11,451/-. He prayed to direct the appellant to correct the bill, withdraw the demand notice and to pay the costs.

The appellant, U.P. State Corporation Ltd. filed the objections regarding maintainability of the above said petition. It was alleged that the complainant had industrial connection which was disconnected earlier due to the arrears of electricity dues. On a checking held on 17th March, 2004 by Sub-Divisional Officer-II and Junior Engineer, it was found that the L.T. line of three phases passing from the other side of the premises of the complainant was tapped with the cables attached with the meter though they were disconnected earlier and the complainant was using full 10 horse power load by committing theft of electricity by bye-passing the meter.

7. Case of Prithvi Pal Singh Prithvi Pal Singh filed a complaint before the District Consumer Protection Forum-II, Moradabad that he is a consumer having connection No.0102/102474 with a sanctioned load of 6 KW. It was alleged that the U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. got his premises inspected by its team and subsequently sent a notice to him on 1st December, 2005. In the said notice it was alleged that the Enforcement team on inspection made on 25th November, 2004 found that the complainant was committing theft of electricity by making a cut at the cable prior to meter and was using excess load. He challenged the bill raised by the Corporation for Rs.1,45,546/- and prayed for compensation of 10,000/- for harassment.

8. Case of Zulfikar Zulfikar filed a complaint before the District Consumer Protect Forum- II, Moradabad, challenging a notice of assessment. He stated that he is a consumer of commercial electricity connection bearing No.3293/115275, the sanctioned load of which is 3 KW. According to him on receipt of notice he enquired about the same to the appellant and came to know that on the basis of checking report they have issued the bill. It was alleged that the said checking report dated 22nd July, 2004 is false and fabricated and no checking was done on the premises of the complainant.

The appellant, U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. filed objections raising the question of maintainability of the complaint on the ground that the complainant Zulfikar had commercial connection and hence does not fall within the definition of ‘Consumer'. It was alleged that Enforcement Squad and Assistant Engineer (Raids) on 22nd July, 2004 raided the premises of the complainant and during the inspection found that 4 leads of the PVC cable of electricity line leading to the meter had been cut and bye-passing the same, 5.76 KW load was being used by the complainant illegally. They alleged theft of electricity against the complainant for which an assessment notice was issued. It was contended that theft of electricity does not amount to deficiency in service, therefore, the Consumer Forum does not have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition regarding the theft of the electricity under the Consumer Protection Act.

9. Case of Shahzadey Alam Shahzadey Alam filed a complaint case before the District Consumer Protection Forum-II, Moradabad challenging the revenue assessment notice dated 9th February, 2005 and requested to pay the compensation for mental and physical agony. In his petition Shahzadey Alam stated that he was consumer of electricity connection No.0832782700, having a sanctioned load of 2 KW. On 20th October, 1986, the officials of the U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. disconnected the aforesaid electricity connection for non-payment of Suvidh Shulka. As the said electricity connection was not required for the complainant, he did not get the same restored. It is alleged that in spite of the same, the complainant received a notice of assessment on 16th February, 2005.

The appellant, U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. on appearance challenged the maintainability of the petition before the Consumer Forum. It was stated that the complainant had himself admitted that his electricity connection was disconnected on 20th October, 1986, therefore, the petition was not maintainable. It was further alleged that the complainant has a factory which was raided and checked by the enforcement squad on 24th January, 2005 at 4.10 hours and that it was found that the complainant was committing theft of electricity by cutting three phase cable going near his premises to the connection No.2783/116398 of L.M.V.-II category of Shri Javed and by connecting it with 15 meters cable and using 4.70 K.W. load and that no valid connection was found in the premises of the complainant. Therefore, the complainant was asked to deposit compounding fee of Rs.1,02,400/-, but he has not deposited it. On the basis of the report a notice was issued to the complainant.

10. Case of Atul Kumar Gupta Atul Kumar Gupta filed a complaint before the District Consumer Protection Forum-II, Moradabad, stating that he is a consumer of electricity connection No.1034/117269, having sanctioned load of 7.5 KW. It is alleged that the electricity connection of the complainant has been disconnected on 29th February, 2003 on the ground of outstanding electricity charges. Later on, the appellant informed that a case in connection with checking is under consideration and, therefore, the connection of the complainant cannot be restored. The complainant alleged that on 13th March, 2004 he received Revenue assessment notice alongwith a checking report No.164 dated 1st March, 2004, though no checking was conducted at the premises of the complainant on 1st March, 2004. He prayed for cancellation of the assessment notice dated 10th March, 2004 and claimed compensation of Rs.5,000/- towards mental agony and financial loss.

11. Case of Tauseef Ahmed Tauseef Ahmed moved before the District Consumer Protection Forum-II, Moradabad and stated that he is a consumer of electricity having connection No.115694 with sanctioned load of 2 KW. He alleged that three employees of the U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. visited his premises. Out of them one represented himself to be the Junior Engineer and demanded bribe of Rs.6,000/- illegally. As he refused to pay the amount, a notice was served on him on 8th September, 2004 along with a report dated 11th August, 2004 and a bill for Rs.1,94,382/- was raised. He challenged the bill before the District Forum.

The U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. on appearance raised the question of maintainability of the petition, one of the grounds taken was that the complainant has already filed an Original Suit No.391 of 2004 (Tauseef Ahmed vs. Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation) for the same relief before the Court of Civil Judge (Junior Division), Moradabad in which summons has already been issued and the matter is pending. It was alleged that the premises of the claimant was checked on 11th August, 2004 in the presence of the complainant and on checking it was found that 6.945 KW of electricity had been illegally used instead of sanctioned load of 2 KW. It was brought to the notice of the Forum that use of excess load than the sanctioned electric load for any other purpose for which connection has been granted, comes within the meaning of ""pilferage of electricity” as defined under U.P. Electricity (Consumers) Regulation, 1984 for which notice of assessment was sent to the complainant for recovery of sum of Rs.1,94,382/- which on hearing the parties was finalized to be Rs.1,07,985/- vide order dated 1st October, 2004.

12. Case of Mohd. Yunus Mohd. Yunus filed a complaint before the District Consumer Protection Forum-II, Moradabad claiming to be a consumer of commercial electricity having connection No.2701/0-98494, with sanctioned load of 5 KW. It was alleged that on the basis of a checking report dated 17th November, 2004 revenue assessment notice dated 1st February, 2005 was served on him. He sought for a copy of the report and came to know that Junior Engineer had sent a false checking report to the Divisional Office because of non- payment of monthly ""Suvidha Sulk"" by the complainant. He challenged the revenue assessment notice dated 1st February, 2005 and claimed compensation of Rs.10,000/- for mental suffering and financial loss.

The U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. on appearance raised the question of maintainability of the petition. It was stated that the complainant is a consumer of L.M.V.-II category using electricity for commercial purposes, therefore, he does not fall under the definition of “consumer"", as defined under Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act. It was further alleged that on 17th November, 2004 on checking of the premises of the complainant by Sub-Divisional Officer-II, Moradabad and Junior Engineer it was found that the complainant was using the connection for industrial purposes under L.M.V.-6 category without any prior consent of the U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. He was using electrical energy for the purposes other than the purpose for which it was sanctioned. Therefore, the complainant was found to be guilty of pilferage of electricity.

13. All the cases against the U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. were filed before the District Consumer Protection Forum-II, Moradabad. The decision having given in favour of the complainants, U.P. Power Corporation Ltd moved before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow which by its common judgment dated 31st January, 2007/Ist February, 2007 dismissed all the revision petitions filed by the U.P. Power Corporation Ltd.",Civil Case

"7. In Civil Appeal Nos.3595-3612 of 1999 the respondents therein who were temporarily engaged on daily wages in the Commercial Taxes Department in some of the districts of the State of Karnataka claim that they worked in the department based on such engagement for more than 10 years and hence they are entitled to be made permanent employees of the department, entitled to all the benefits of regular employees. They were engaged for the first time in the years 1985-86 and in the teeth of orders not to make such appointments issued on 3.7.1984. Though the Director of Commercial Taxes recommended that they be absorbed, the Government did not accede to that recommendation. These respondents thereupon approached the Administrative Tribunal in the year 1997 with their claim. The Administrative Tribunal rejected their claim finding that they have not made out a right either to get wages equal to that of others regularly employed or for regularization. Thus, the applications filed were dismissed. The respondents approached the High Court of Karnataka challenging the decision of the Administrative Tribunal. It is seen that the High Court without really coming to grips with the question falling for decision in the light of the findings of the Administrative Tribunal and the decisions of this Court, proceeded to order that they are entitled to wages equal to the salary and allowances that are being paid to the regular employees of their cadre in government service with effect from the dates from which they were respectively appointed. It may be noted that this gave retrospective effect to the judgment of the High Court by more than 12 years. The High Court also issued a command to the State to consider their cases for regularization within a period of four months from the date of receipt of that order. The High Court seems to have proceeded on the basis that, whether they were appointed before 01.07.1984, a situation covered by the decision of this Court in Dharwad District Public Works Department vs. State of Karnataka (1990 (1) SCR 544) and the scheme framed pursuant to the direction thereunder, or subsequently, since they have worked for a period of 10 years, they were entitled to equal pay for equal work from the very inception of their engagement on daily wages and were also entitled to be considered for regularization in their posts.

"Although the record of these Appeals is voluminous, the salient facts lie within a narrow compass. The First Appellant in both these Appeals, namely, the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to in short as ""the Corporation""), was incorporated on February 22, 1967. The majority of the shares of the Corporation were at all times and still are held by the Union of India which is the Second Respondent in these Appeals, and the remaining shares were and are held by the State of West Bengal and the State of Assam. Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1959 (Act No.l of 1956), provides as follows :

""617. Definition of 'Government Company'.- For the purposes of this Act Government company means any company in which not less than fifty-one per cent of the paid-up share capital is held by the Central Government, or by any State Government or Governments, or partly by the Central Government and partly by one or more State Governments and includes a company which is a subsidiary of a Government company as thus defined.""
The above facts and the provisions aforementioned of the Memorandum of Association and the Articles of Association clearly show that not only is the Corporation a Government company of which all the shares were and are owned by the Central Government and two State Governments but is a Government company which is under the complete control and management of the Central Government.

A company called the ""Rivers Steam Navigation Company Limited"" was carrying on very much the same business including the maintenance and running of river service as the Corporation is doing. A Scheme of Arrangement was entered into between the said company and the Corporation. The Calcutta High Court by its order dated May 5, 1967, approved the said Scheme of Arrangement and order the closure of the said Company and further directed that upon payment to all the creditors of the said Company, the said Company would stand dissolved without winding up by an order to be obtained from the High Court and accordingly, upon payment to all the creditors, the said Company was ordered to be dissolved. The said Scheme of Arrangement provided that the assets and certain liabilities of the said Company would be taken over by the Corporation. The said Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the High Court also provided as follows :

""a) That the new Company shall take as many of the existing staff or labour as possible and as can be reasonably taken over by the said transferee Company subject to any valid objection to any individual employee or employees.
b) That as to exactly how many can be employed it is left to the said transferee Company's bona fide discretion.
c) That those employees who cannot be taken over shall be paid by the transferor Company all moneys due to them under the law and all legitimate and legal compensations payable to them either under Industrial Disputes Act or otherwise legally admissible and that such moneys shall be provided by the Government of India to the existing transferor Company who will pay these dues.""
The First Respondent in Civil Appeal No. 4412 of 1985, Brojo Nath Ganguly, was, at the date when the said Scheme of Arrangement became effective, working in the said Company and his services were taken over by the Corporation and he was appointed on September 8, 1967, as a Deputy Chief Accounts Officer. The First Respondent in Civil Appeal No. 4413 of 1985, Tarun Kanti Sengupta, was also working in the said Company and his services were also taken over by the Corporation and he was appointed on September 8, 1967, as Chief Engineer on the ship ""River Ganga"". It is unnecessary to refer at this stage to the terms and conditions of the letters of appointment issued to these two Respondents as they have been subsequently superseded by service rules framed by the Corporation except to state that under the said letters of appointment the age of superannuation was fifty-five years unless the Corporation agreed to retain them beyond this period. The said letters of appointment also provided that these Respondents would be subject to the service rules and regulations including the conduct rules. Service rules were framed by the Corporation for the first time in 1970 and were replaced by new rules in 1979.

So far as Sengupta, the First Respondent in Civil Appeal No. 4413 of 1985, is concerned, he was promoted to the post of General Manager (River Services) with effect from January 1, 1980. His name was enrolled by the Bureau of Public Enterprises and he was called for an interview for the post of Chairman-cum-Director of the Corporation by the Public Enterprises Selection Board. According to Sengupta, he could not appear before the Selection Board as he received the letter calling him for the interview after the date fixed in D that behalf. According to Sengupta, the new Chairman-cum-Managing Director who was selected at the said interview bore a grudge against him for having competed against him for the said post and on February 1, 1983, he issued a charge-sheet against Sengupta intimating to him that a disciplinary inquiry was proposed to be held against him under the said Rules and calling upon him to file his written statement of defence. By his letter dated February 10, 1983, addressed to the Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Sengupta denied the charges made against him and asked for inspection of documents and copies of statements of witnesses mentioned in the said charge-sheet. By a letter dated February 26, 1983, signed by the Chairman-cum-Managing Director notice was given to Sengupta under clause (i) of Rule 9 of the said Rule, terminating his service with the Corporation with immediate effect. Along with the said letter a cheque for three months' basic pay and dearness allowance in lieu of notice was enclosed. G Both Ganguly and Sengupta filed writ petitions in Calcutta High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the termination of their service as also the validity of the said Rule 9(i). In both these writ petitions rule nisi was issued and an ex parte interim order staying the operation of the said notice of termination was passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court. The Appellants before us went in Letters Patent Appeal before a Division Bench of the said High Court against the said ad interim orders, the appeal in the case of Ganguly being F.M.A.T. No. 1604 of 1983 and in the case of Sengupta being F.M.A.T. No. 649 of 1983. On January 28, 1985, the Division Bench ordered in both these Appeals that the said writ petitions should stand transferred to and heard by it along with the said appeals. The said appeals and writ petitions were thereupon heard together and by a common judgment delivered on August 9, 1985, the Division Bench held that the Corporation was a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and that the said Rule 9(i) was ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution. Consequently the Division Bench struck down the said Rule 9(i) as being void. It also quashed the impugned orders of termination dated February 26, 1983. It is against the said judgment and orders of the Calcutta High Court that the present Appeals by Special Leave have been filed.

The framers of our Constitution did not, however, want to frame for the Sovereign Democratic Republic which was to emerge from their labours a Constitution in the strict legal sense. They were aware that there were other Constitutions which had given expression to certain ideals as the goal towards which the country should strive and which had defined the principles considered fundamental to the governance of the country. They were aware of the events that had culminated in the Charter of the United Nations. They were aware that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had been adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, for India was a signatory to it. They were aware that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contained certain basic and fundamental rights appertaining to all men. They were aware that these rights were born of the philosophical speculations of the Greek and Roman Stoics and nurtured by the jurists of ancient Rome. They were aware that these rights had found expression in a limited form in the accords entered into between the rulers and their powerful nobles, as for instance, the accord of 1188 entered into between King Alfonso IX and the Cortes of Leon, the Magna Carta of 1215 wrested from King John of England by his barons on the Meadow of Runnymede and to which he was compelled to affix his Great Seal on a small island in the Thames in Buckinghamshire - still called Magna Carta Island, and the guarantees which King Andrew II of Hungary was forced to give by his Golden Bull of 1822. They were aware of the international treaties of the midseventeenth century for safeguarding the right of religious freedom and the rights of aliens. They were aware of the full blossoming of the concept of Human Rights in the writings of the ""philosophes"" such as Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Rayal, d'Alembert and others, and of the concrete expression given to it in the various Declarations of Rights of the American Colonies (particularly Virginia) and in the American Declaration of Independence. They were aware that in 1789, during the early years of the French Revolution, the French National Assembly had in ""The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen"" proclaimed these rights in lofty words and that Revolutionary France had translated them into practice with bloody deeds. They were aware of the treaties entered into between various States in the nineteenth century providing protection for religious and other minorities. They were aware that these rights had at last found universal recognition in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They were aware that the first ten Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America contained certain rights akin to Human Rights. They knew that the Constitution of Eire contained a chapter headed ""Fundamental Rights"" and another headed ""Directive Principles of State Policy"". They were aware that the Constitution of Japan also contained a chapter headed ""Rights and Duties of the People"". They were aware that the major traditional functions of the State have been the defence of its territory and its inhabitants against external aggression, the maintenance of law and order; the administration of justice, the levying of taxes and the collection of revenue. They were also aware that increasingly, and particularly in modern times, several States have assumed numerous and wide ranging functions, especially in the fields of education, health, social security, control and maintenance of natural resources and natural assets, transport and communication services and operation of certain industries considered basic to the economy and growth of the nation. They were also aware that section 8 of Article 1 of the Constitution of the United States of America contained ""a welfare clause"" empowering the federal government to enact laws for the overall general welfare of the people. They were aware that countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany had passed social welfare legislation.",Constitutional Case

"Challapan's case decided three appeals against a common judgment of the High Court of Rajasthan allowing the writ petitions filed by three railway servants. Challappan, the respondent in one of these appeals, was a railway-pointsman. He was arrested at Olavakkot Railway Station platform for disorderly, drunken and indecent behaviour and was prosecuted and convicted under section 51(a) of the Kerala Police Act. Instead of sentencing him, the sub-magistrate, Palghat, released him on probation under section of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958. Thereafter he was removed from service by the disciplinary authority of the Department, without holding any inquiry, on the basis of his conviction in the said criminal case. The order of removal from service was made under clause (i) of rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules. The Kerala High Court held that as no penalty was imposed upon him, clause (i) of rule 14 did not in terms apply, and allowed his writ petition. So far as the other two railway employees were concerned, one was convicted under section 3 of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, and the other under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. Both of them were released on probation and were similarly removed from railway service.

The respondent, Tulsiram Patel, was a permanent auditor in the Regional Audit Officer, M.E.S., Jabalpur. It appears that orders were issued by Headquarters, C.D.A. C.C., Meerut, stopping the increment of the Respondent for one year. One Raj Kumar Jairath was at the relevant time the Regional Audit Officer, M.E.S., Jabalpur. On July 27,1976, the Respondent went to Raj Kumar's office and demanded an explanation from him as to why he had stopped his increment whereupon Raj Kumar replied that he was nobody to stop his increment. The Respondent then struck Raj Kumar on the head with an iron rod. Raj Kumar fell down, his head bleeding. The Respondent was tried and convicted under section 332 of the Indian Penal Code by the First Class Judicial Magistrate, Jabalpur. The Magistrate instead of sentencing the Respondent to imprisonment applied to him the provisions of section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, and released him on his executing a bond of good behaviour for a period of one year. The Respondents appeal against his conviction was dismissed by the Sessions Judge, Jabalpur. The Controller General of Defence Accounts, who was the disciplinary authority in the case, imposed upon the Respondent the penalty of compulsory retirement under clause (i) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules. The said order was in the following terms :

""WHEREAS Shri T.R. Patel, Pt. Auditor (Account No.8295888) has been convicted on a criminal charge, to wit, under Section 332 of I.P.C., WHEREAS it is considered that the conduct of the said Shri T.R.Patel, Pt.Auditor,(Account No. 8295888) which has led to his conviction, is such as to render his further retention in the public service undesirable, Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by Rule 19(i) of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, the undersigned hereby direct that the said Shri T.R. Patel, Pt. Auditor, (Account No.8295888) shall be compulsorily retired from service with effect from 25.11.1980.""
Before dealing with the relevant facts, we may mention that the counter affidavit filed to the writ petition in both the said High Courts were unsatisfactory. At the hearing of these Appeals an application was made on behalf of the Appellants for leave to file a supplementary return. This application was granted by us in the interest of justice and the supplementary Return annexed to the said application was taken on the record. We will now briefly set out the facts which led to the passing of the impugned orders. The Respondents in Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982 are dismissed members of the CISF Unit at Bokaro Steel Plant of the Bokaro Steel Limited situate at Bokaro in the State of Bihar temporary security guard in the CISF Unit posted at Security Paper Mill at Hoshangabad in the State of Madhya Pradesh. We will first deal with the facts of Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982. The members of the CISF Unit at Bokaro had formed an all-India association in March 1979 and one Sadanand Jha, Respondent No. 1, was elected as its General Secretary. Thereafter, a country wide agitation was carried on for recognition of the said association. In June 1979 some of the members of the said association were called upon to meet the Home Minister at Delhi. A delegation of the said association went to Delhi. While there they staged a demonstration. Some of the demonstrators, including Sadanand Jha, were arrested. What happened thereafter can best be related by extracting paragraphs 3 to 9 of the supplementary Return filed by Shri Madan Gopal, the Deputy Inspector- General, CISF Unit of Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro, pursuant to the leave granted by this Court. These paragraphs read as follows :

""3. The said persons were arrested at Delhi, but subsequently released on bail. At Bokaro Steel Plant, the agitation which was going on assumed aggravated from on and from 27th May, 1979. Out of 1900 persons belonging to CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro about 1000 persons participated in the processions and violent demonstrations. The said employees indulged in agitational acts and violent indiscipline. The said personnel unleashed a reign of terror in the unit lines and openly incited others to disobey the lawful orders. The said persons indulged in several acts of violence and created a very serious law & order problem and an atmosphere of collective violence and intimidation. The said agitation and the violent activity reached a very serious proportion in the last week of June, 1979 with the result that Army had to be called by the State Authorities on 23.6.1979. Annexed hereto and marked Annexure AFD- I is the request from the Home Commissioner, Bihar Government to the Ministry of Defence, Government of India dated 23.6.1979 requesting for the deployment of the Army so as to restore normalcy in the area. The State Government had also deployed 9 Magistrates to assist the Army authorities as also the CRPF for restoring the normal conditions at the Bokaro Steel Plant. A copy of the order is enclosed herewith and market as Annexure AFD-II
4. On 24.6.1979, on seeing the arrival of the Army, the agitators started making preparations for armed resistance by putting up sand bags, flood lights and barricades in the CISF Lines. They had gained the control of CISF Lines and the Officers were not allowed to have any access to the Lines or to other ranks of CISF.
5. On 25.6.1979, the Army along with 9 Magistrates took up positions round the CISF Lines in the early hours and called upon the agitators to give up charge of the Armoury. Inspite of giving repeated warnings by the authorities to give up charge of the Armoury, the agitators did not give up arms, but, instead, resorted to violence. The agitators started firing at 0320 hours at the Army. The Army returned the fire. The said exchange of fire continued for 3 hours before the Army could spell out the violent retaliation of the agitators. The said violent exchange of fire resulted in the instant death of one Army Major and 2 more Army personnel were also killed as a result of firing by the CISF personnel.
6. It may also be stated that there were 22 death in the course of the said pitched battle, which went on for three hours between the violent armed agitators and the Army.
7. In regard to the aforesaid violent activities and the commission of offences, about 800 personnel were rounded up by the Army and later on arrested by the local police. It is pertinent to mention here that at the relevant time, about 1900 personnel were deployed in CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro. More than 1000 personnel participated in the aforesaid agitational activities. Besides the persons arrested by the authorities concerned, a substantial number of agitators were at large. Most of them either fled away or went underground and large number of arms and ammunitions were also with them. The search and seizure of arms and ammunition were going on and as a result thereof up till 1.7.1979, 65 rifles along with large quantity of ammunitions, 11 Molotov cooktails, 20 kgs. of sulphur, 20 kgs of glass chips and other explosives and 1048 empties of .303 ammunition were recovered from the area after the Army action. A copy of the FIR lodged in connection with aforesaid commission of offences is annexed herewith and marked as Annexure (AFD-III).
8. Notwithstanding the arrest of the said about 800 employees, as aforesaid, atmosphere at the Bokaro Steel Plant continued to be vitiated due to terror and collective fear and the functioning of the CISF Unit and its administration at Bokaro had completely broken down. It was only Army which could control the situation by its continued presence. The Army was withdrawn from the Bokaro Steel Plant only on or about 2.7.1979, however it may not be out of place to mention here that although the Army was withdrawn in the early July, 1979 but atmosphere of terror and tension continued for a couple of months. The CRPF continued performing security duties till Nov. 79. Besides this Bihar Military Police took charge of armoury from army and continued to perform some of armed duties of CISF as CISF Unit was not in a position to function normally for a considerable time. Even the State authority apprehended a dangerous situation after the Army action including threat to lives of senior officers of CISF.
9. In the meanwhile, having regard to the violent and disturbed situation which prevailed in the Bokaro Steel Plant as also the collective actions of violence, mass terror and intimidation and threats to supervisory and loyal staff, it was reasonably believed that any inquiry in accordance with the provisions of the Rules 34, 35 and 36 of CISF Rules, 1969 or in accordance with the requirements of Article 311(2) would be dangerous, counter productive and would aggravate the already existing dangerous situation. It was also reasonably believed that the circumstances were such as would make the holding of any inquiry self-defeating, subversive or would result in consequent detriment to public interest. It was in these circumstances that the concerned authorities formed reasonable nexus that any inquiry in accordance with the rules was reasonably impracticable and impugned orders were passed in view thereof.""
We have already held that in applying clause (c) of the second proviso the Governor of a State acts on his subjective satisfaction taking into consideration facts and factors which are not proper matters for judicial review. However, the claim of privilege was waived by the Government and all the materials produced at the hearing and inspection given to the other side. These materials disclose that an incident took place on January 18, 1981, at the annual Mela held at Gwalior in which one man was burnt alive. Some persons, including a constable from each of these two Forces, were arrested. These persons were remanded into judicial custody. On January 20, 1981, several members of these two Forces indulged in violent demonstrations and rioted at the Mela ground, demanding the release of their colleagues. They attacked the police station at the Mela ground, ransacked it and forced the operator to close down the wireless set. The situation became so dangerous that senior district and police officers had to approach the Judicial Magistrate at night and get the two arrested constables released on bail. The incident was discussed at a Cabinet meeting, a decision was taken and the advice of the Council of Ministers was tendered to the Governor of Madhya Pradesh who accepted it and issued the impugned orders. On further scrutiny some names were deleted from the list of dismissed personnel and some others included. As a result of this, some other members of these Forces began carrying on an active propaganda against the Government, visiting Jabalpur and other places in the State of Madhya Pradesh, holding secret meetings, distributing leaflets, and inciting the constabulary in these places to rise against the administration as a body in protest against the action taken by the Government. On this information being received, they too were similarly dismissed. These facts speak for themselves. The police normally oppose the grant of bail to an accused but here we have the paradoxical situation of some of the highest police and district officers going at midnight to the Magistrate's house to apply for bail for the accused. The police are the guardians of law and order. They stand guard at the border between the green valleys of law and order and the rough and hilly terrain of lawlessness and public disorder. If these guards turn law-breakers and create violent public disorder and incite others to do the same, we can only exclaim with Juvenal, ""Quis custodiet ipsos' Custodes?""- who is to guard the guards themselves?""

(Satires, VI,347). These facts leave no doubt that the situation was such that prompt and urgent action was necessary and the holding of a inquiry into the conduct of each of the Petitioners would not have been expedient in the interest of the security of the State. All these four Petitions, therefore deserve to be dismissed.
Final Orders in the Appeals and Writ Petitions For the reasons set out above, we pass the following orders in the above matters :
(1) Civil Appeal No. 6814 of 1983 is allowed and the judgment and order appealed against are reversed and set aside and the writ petition filed by the Respondent in the High Court is hereby dismissed.
(2) Writ Petitions Nos. 1953,7393,1392 and 2022 of 1981 are hereby dismissed.
(3) All the remaining Writ Petitions and all the Transferred Cases and Civil Appeals Nos. 3231 of 1981 and 4067 of 1983 are dismissed while Civil Appeals Nos. 3484 and 3512 of 1982 are allowed and the judgments and orders appealed against are reversed and set aside and the writ petitions filed by the Respondents in the High Courts are hereby dismissed. We direct the appellate authority under the Central Industrial Security Force Rules, 1969, to dispose of as expeditiously as possible such appeals of the members of the Central Industrial Security Force as may still be pending. In the case of those government servants in this particular group of matters who have not filed any appeal, in view of the fact that they were relying upon the decision of this Court in Chalappan's case, we give them time till September 30, 1985, to file a departmental appeal, if so advised, and we direct the concerned appellate authority to condone in the exercise of its power under the relevant service rule the delay in filing the appeal and, subject to what is stated in this Judgment under the headings ""Service Rules and the Second Proviso - Challappan's case and ""The Second Proviso - Clause
(b)"", to hear the appeal on merits.
(4) All interim orders made in the above matters are vacated but the government servants will not be liable to refund any amount so far paid to them.
(5) There will be no order as to costs in all the above matters.
(6) All other matters pending in this Court in which a question of the interpretation of the second proviso to clause (2) of Article 311 or of an analogous service rule is involved will stand disposed of in accordance with this Judgment.",Civil Case
"Considering the importance of the issue raised in the letter being concerned by frequent complaints regarding custodial violence and deaths in police lock up, the letter was treated as a writ petition and notice was issued on 9.2.1987 to the respondents.

In response to the notice, the State of West Bengal filed a counter. It was maintained that the police was no hushing up any matter of lock-up death and that whereever police personnel were found to be responsible for such death, action was being initiated against them. The respondents characterised the writ petition as misconceived, misleading and untenable in law.

While the writ petition was under consideration a letter addressed by Shri Ashok Kumar Johri on 29.7.87 to the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India drawing the attention of this Court to the death of one Mahesh Bihari of Pilkhana, Aligarh in police custody was received. That letter was also treated as a writ petition and was directed to be listed alongwith the writ petition filed by Shri D.K. Basu. On 14.8.1987 this Court made the following order :

""In almost every states there are allegations and these allegations are now increasing in frequency of deaths in custody described generally by newspapers as lock-up deaths. At present there does not appear to be any machinery to effectively deal with such allegations. Since this is an all India question concerning all States, it is desirable to issues notices to all the State Governments to find out whether they are desire to say anything in the matter. Let notices issue to all the State Governments. Let notice also issue to the Law Commission of India with a request that suitable suggestions may be returnable in two months from today.""
In response to the notice, affidavits have been filed on behalf of the States of West Bengal, Orissa, Assam Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Harayana, Tamil Nadu, Meghalaya , Maharashtra and Manipur. Affidavits have also been filed on behalf of Union Territory of Chandigarh and the Law Commission of India.

During the course of hearing of the writ petitions, the Court felt necessity of having assistance from the Bar and Dr. A.M. Singhvi, senior advocate was requested to assist the Court as amicus curiae.",Criminal Case

"Shorn of details, brief facts necessary for disposal for this appeal are that on November 28, 1977 a suit, filed by the appellants, was decreed and an injunction was issued to the defendant-respondents to close down the passage carved out by opening a door from the wall and further the defendants were restrained from using that passage. On August 7, 1986 an application for execution of the decree was filed in the Executing Court on the ground that the injunction were being violated. The judgement debtor filed objections to the Execution Application and raised a preliminary objection to the effect that the Execution Application was barred by time. The Executing Court vide order dated May 6, 1987 upheld the preliminary objection and held the Execution Application to the barred by time. The matter was taken up in revision to the High Court. On 25.4 .1989, the Civil Revision Petition against the order of Execution Court was allowed. Gupta, J. allowing the civil revision petition held that the case was covered by Article 181 of the Jammu & Kashmir Limitation Act and the opinion of the Executing Court that it was covered by Article 182 of the J & K Limitation Act was by time.

He had sought for voluntary retirement and a preferential appointment to his son Amit Kumar who was called for a written examination which he had qualified but his name has not been included in the list of selected candidates on the ground that the employee has less than 20 years of service, therefore challenging this, applicant is before us.

And being rich, my virtue then shall be To say there is no vice but beggary

3. A similar situation is postulated here the Railway Board thinks that some special benefits may be made available to certain categories of people under the feeling that their work is strenuous and because of that they are subjected to vagaries of extreme weather condition and as a result infirmity associated with an early ageing process sets on along with other diminishment.When the body process is thus catches up quite early in life and to ameliorate its effect issue some Schemes which are reproduced herein. But we must examine these openly in the configuration of morality and legality.

(vi)The ward will be considered for appointment only in the lowest recruitment grade of the respective category from which the employee seeks retirement, depending upon his/her eligibility and suitability, but not in any other category.

(xi)Those who have completed 33 years of qualifying service and are in the age group of 55 to 57 years would be considered in the first phase of the scheme to be followed by those in the age group of 53 years onwards but less than 55 years.

(xii)The conditions of eligibility, in the case of wards, being considered for appointment would be the same as prescribed for direct recruitment from the open market.

II) Later on, vide RBE No.131/2010 [No.E(P&A)I-2010/RT-2 dated 11.09.2010. the Railway Board modified the SRRC with the nomenclature Liberalized Active Retirement Scheme for Guaranteed Employment for Safety Staff (LARGESS) and extended the benefits to other safety categories of the staff with Grade Pay of Rs.1800 per month. The qualifying service has also been reduced from 33 years to 20 years and the eligible age group has been reduced from 55-57 years to 557 years. However, the condition of qualifying service (i.e. 33 years and age group (i.e. 55-57) for drivers remained unchanged. The said order is also reproduced as under:-

Subject: Safety Related Retirement Scheme covering safety categories with Grady Pay Rs.1800/-
[No.E9P&A)I-2010/RT-2 dated 11.09.2010) Please refer to Boards letter No.E(P&A)I-2001RT-2 (KW) dated 02.01.2004 (Bahris RBO 4/2002, p-5) regarding introduction of Safety related retirement scheme (SRRS) for Drivers and Gangmen.
2. It has now been decided to extend the benefit of scheme to other safety categories of staff with a grade pay of Rs.1800/-pm. The qualifying service has been reduced from 33 years to 20 years and the eligible age group of 55-57 years to 50-57 years for seeking retirement under the scheme in the case of safety categories with grade pay of Rs.1800. The list of safety categories covered under the scheme is enclosed as Annexure.
3. It has also been decided to modify the nomenclature of the scheme as Liberalized Active Retirement Scheme for Guaranteed Employment for Safety Staff (LARGESS) with grade pay of Rs.1800. However, the employment under the scheme would be guaranteed only to those found eligible/suitable and finally selected as per procedure.
4. The condition of qualifying service (i.e. 33 years and age group (i.e. 55-57) for drivers will remain unchanged.
5. The other terms and conditions of the Scheme will remain unchanged.
6. This issues with the concurrence of the Finance Directorate of the Ministry of Railways.
15. Further, the Government of India has already enacted The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 to safeguard the interests of any employee who acquires disability during his service. The said act is equally applicable for the employees of the Railways. Section 47 of the said Act reads as under:-
47. Non-discrimination in government Employment  (I) No establishment shall dispense with, or reduce in rank, an employee who acquires a disability during his service:
Provided that, if an employee, after acquiring disability is not suitable for the post he was holding, could be shifted to some other post with the same pay scale and service benefits: Provided further that if it is not possible to adjust the employee against any post, he may be kept on a supernumerary post until a suitable post is available or he attains the age of superannuation, whichever is earlier.
(2) No promotion shall be denied to a person merely on the ground of his disability:
Provided that the appropriate Government may, having regard to the type of work carried on in any establishment, by notification and subject to such conditions, fi any, as may be specified in such notification, exempt any establishment from the provisions of this section.
16. Moreover, the Railways themselves have their separate statutory rules to protect the disabled/medically decategorised employees of any particular post. They are given alternative employments. The relevant rules in Chapter XIII of the Indian Railway Establishment Manual Volume-I are reproduced as under:-
CHAPTER XIII Absorption of disabled/medically decategorised staff in Alternative Employment.

A Railway servant who fails in a vision test or otherwise by virtue of disability acquired during service becomes physically incapable of performing the duties of the post which he occupies should not be dispensed with or reduced in rank, but should be shifted to some other post with the same pay scale and service benefits.
1302. Classification of Railway Servants declared medically unfit  Railway servants acquiring disability during service and declared medically unfit are divisible into two groups:-
I Those completely disabled for further service in any post in the Railway, i.e. those who cannot be declared fit even in the Cmedical category; and ii. Those disabled/incapacitated for further service in the post they are holding but declared fit in a lower medical category and eligible for retention in service in posts corresponding to this lower medical category.
1303. The railway servants both in groups(i) and group(ii) of Para 1302 cease to perform the duties of the posts they are holding from the date they are declared medically unfit for the present post. No officer has the authority to permit the Railway Servant concerned to perform the duties in the post beyond that date. If such a Railway Servant cannot be immediately adjusted against or absorbed in any suitable alternative post he may be kept on a special supernumerary post in the grade in which the employee concerned was working on regular basis before being declared medically unfit pending location of suitable alternative employment for him with the same pay scale and service benefits, efforts to locate suitable alternative employment starting immediately. The special supernumerary post so created will stand abolished as soon as the alternative employment is located.
(Authority: Ministry of Railways letter No.E(NG)I-2004/RE-3/9 dt. 7.12.2005) 1304: Disabled Medically decategorised staff to be absorbed in posts they can adequately fill:- In the matter of absorption of disabled/medically decategorised staff in alternative posts, Railway administrations should take care to ensure that the alternative employment offered is only in posts which the staff can adequately fill and as far as possible should broadly be in allied categories where their background and experience in earlier posts could be utilised. While finding alternative posts for absorption of disabled/medically decategorised staff, the Railway Administration should ensure that the interests of other staff in service are not adversely affected and no reversion of any officiating Railway servant is made to absorb the disabled/medically decategorised staff. For this purpose, attempts should be made to absorb the disabled/medically decategorised Railway servant not only within the Unit/Division or Department, but in other Unit/Division or Department.
1305. Absorption in posts identified for employment of physically handicapped persons/creation of supernumerary posts. The Railway servants falling in group (i) mentioned in para 1302 i.e. those who are declared unfit even for the lowest medically category, may be absorbed in a post/category identified as suitable for employment of physically handicapped persons and fresh recruitment to that post/category from open market from amongst physically handicapped withheld. In case the alternative post is not carrying the requisite pay scale, a supernumerary post may be created in appropriate scale of pay and the employee adjusted against the same keeping the lower grade post vacant by withholding fresh recruitment thereto. The supernumerary post so created to accommodate a disabled/medically incapacitated employee shall stand abolished as soon as a suitable post in the appropriate scale is found for the Railway servant concerned or the post is vacated by him for other reasons, whichever is earlier.
(Authority: Ministry of Railways letter No.E(NG)I-2004/RE-3/9 dt. 7.12.2005) 1306. Steps to be taken for finding alternative employment
1. With a view to determined the categories in which the disabled/medically decategorised Railway servant is suitable for absorption, a committee should examined him. The committee may consist of two or three officers posted at the headquarters of the officer under whom the disabled/medically decategorised Railway servant was working, the Railway servants immediate officer being one of the members of the committee. After the committee has examined the Railway servant and determined his suitability for certain categories of posts, the officer under whom the Railway servant was working will proceed to take further action to find suitable alternative employment for him.
2. The officer concerned will prepare a list of vacancies within his jurisdiction in the categories for which the disabled/medically incapacitated Railway servant has been found suitable and a post with same scale of pay as was attached to the post he was holding on regular basis before being declared medically unfit, will be offered to him.
3. It will be the responsibility primarily of the officer under whom the concerned Railway servant was directly working to find suitable alternative employment for him. This will be done first by trying to find alternative employment in the officers own unit/division, office, workshop etc. and a register with the details as mentioned in sub para (6) below will be maintained for this purpose.
4. If there is no immediate prospect of employment in his own unit/division, officer etc/. the name of the Railway servant with particulars as given in sub-para (6) below will be circulated to all other offices or establishments where suitable employment is likely to be found.
5. Nothing in the previous paragraphs, however, debars a Railway servant from applying for a particular post for which he is likely to be deemed suitable and it is known to be vacant under any officer. Such an application must be addressed through the immediate officer of the Railway servant concerned and must contain full particulars of his service and must be forwarded to the officer to whom addressed or to the authority competent to make the appointment. The result of the application must be intimate to the Railway servant.
6. A register containing the names of all Railway servants declared medically unfit and to be absorbed in alternative post will be maintained by Headquarters, Divisional and other extra-Divisional offices. These registers will contain not only the names of the staff of the particular division, etc. but also the names notified to the unit Officer concerned by other unit/offices. This will not, however, absolve officers under whom the Railway servant was last working from continuing their efforts to find suitable employment for the disabled/medically decategorised employee. The particulars required to be maintained in registers and notified to other officers in accordance with the instructions above are as follows:
i. Serial number ii Date on which incapacitated iii Name and Fathers name iv Post last held on regular basis with scale of Pay and rate of pay.
v. Educational qualifications? If no educational qualifications, then general remarks regarding knowledge of English, regional language etc. vi. Medical category in which placed.
vii. Details of special supernumerary post till absorption in alternative appointment (Para 1303).
viii. Date from which absorbed in alternative appointment.
ix. Nature and category of alternative appointment.
	       x.	           Scale of Pay of the alternative post and the pay fixed at.
	      xi.	           Details of supernumerary posts, if any after absorption in Alternative appointment (Para 1305).
	xii		Remarks .

7. If and when a Railway servant is absorbed in an alternative post, intimation will be sent by the officer under whom he was previously working to all other officers to whom his name was notified. On receipt of such intimation, his name will be deleted from the registers.
8. Before any post is filled or a promotion is ordered, officers concerned will refer to their registers and satisfy themselves that no disabled medically incapacitated Railway servant who is suitable for the post is available. If any such disabled/medically incapacitated employee is available, he will be given preference over all other categories of staff for appointment.
5. This matter relates to preferential employment to his son, as prayed for by the applicant, on the ground that he was an employee with the Railway respondents and he took voluntary retirement on the ground of his medical de-categorisation and now the applicant is claiming employment of his son in the nature of a compassionate appointment, which he claims as a matter of right. Several schemes had been framed by the Railways from 2004 onwards, ostensibly to help out employees whose particular nature of work is held to be especially tiresome and, therefore it might be advisable to allow them to retire early and in their place to grant an appointment to their wards. This was for two categories at first but later on it was extended to cover about ten categories now. Besides as against the 5% quota in Direct recruitment for compassionate appointment, this is a 100% replacement of an employee who retires on full benefits and as found in most of the cases within one year of the superannuation. This sort of hereditary appointment had queered the pitch for the actually qualified and meritorious candidates for an employment and consequent livelihood which the State is bound to protect as they may be competitively more meritorious. If the likely back door entries can claim more merit, nothing will stop them from actually competing in the regular selection process. Therefore, these Schemes, as it now stand do not represent the extreme variety represented by the 5 % determination for compassionate appointment. Thus these issues are disposed to secure ultimate injustice for all.",Administrative Case
"The facts of the case are as under:

The petitioner is a young woman now aged about 27 years who is a graduate and at the relevant time was pursuing her Masters course in Hindi in the Lucknow University. Due to the sudden death of her parents she started living with her brother Ajay Pratap Singh at LDA Colony, Kanpur Road, Lucknow, where she did her intermediate in 1997 and graduation in 2000.
It is alleged by the petitioner that on 2.11.2000 she left her brother's house of her own free will and got married at Arya Samaj Mandir, Delhi to one Bramha Nand Gupta who has business in Delhi and other places and they have a child out of this wedlock.
Thereafter on 4.11.2000, the petitioner's brother lodged a missing person report at Sarojini Nagar Police Station, Lucknow and consequently the police arrested two sisters of the petitioner's husband along with the husband of one of the sisters and the cousin of the petitioner's husband. The persons arrested were Mamta Gupta, Sangita Gupta (sisters of Brahma Nand Gupta), as well as Rakesh Gupta (husband of Mamta Gupta) and Kallu Gupta cousin of the petitioner's husband. Mamta was in jail with her one month old child.
It is further alleged that the petitioner's brothers Ajay Pratap Singh, Shashi Pratap Singh and Anand Pratap Singh were furious because the petitioner underwent an inter-caste marriage, and hence they went to the petitioner's husband's paternal residence and vehemently beat up her husband's mother and uncle, threw the luggage, furniture, utensils, etc. from the house and locked it with their lock. One brother of the petitioner's husband was allegedly locked in a room by the petitioner's brothers for four or five days without meals and water. The petitioner's brothers also allegedly cut away the harvest crops of the agricultural field of the petitioner's husband and sold it, and they also took forcible possession of the field. They also lodged a false police report alleging kidnapping of the petitioner against her husband and his relatives at Police Station Sarojini Nagar, Lucknow, due to which the sisters of the petitioner's husband, and the husband of one of the sisters, were arrested and detained in Lucknow jail. The petitioner's brothers also illegally took possession of the shop of the petitioner's husband. The petitioner's husband has a shop at Badan Singh Market, Rangpuri in the name of Gupta Helmet Shop whose possession was forcibly taken over by her brothers.

It is alleged that the petitioner's husband and relatives have been falsely framed by her brothers Shashi Pratap Singh, Ajay Pratap Singh and Anand Pratap Singh who were furious because of the inter-caste marriage of the petitioner with Bramha Nand Gupta. Mamta Gupta, Rakesh Gupta and Sangita Gupta were arrested on 17.12.2000, whereas Kallu Gupta was arrested on 02.12.2000. It is alleged that the three relatives of the petitioner's husband were not granted bail for a long time and their lives got ruined though there was no case against them that they instigated the petitioner to get married to Bramha Nand Gupta. It is also alleged that the petitioner ran from pillar to post to save her husband and relatives from harassment and she then approached the Rajasthan Women Commission, Jaipur, as she was staying in Jaipur almost in hiding apprehending danger to her and her husband's life. The Commission recorded her statement on 13.3.2001 and the same was forwarded to the Superintendent of Police (City), Lucknow for necessary action. The President of the Rajasthan State Women Commission also wrote a letter to the National Human Rights Commission on 13.3.2001 requesting the Commission and the Chief Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh, to intervene in the matter.

The Fast Track Court, Lucknow before whom the case was pending issued non-bailable warrants against all the four accused, and against the order of the Fast Track Court, the accused filed a petition under section 482 Cr.P.C. in the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) which was registered as Crl. Misc. No. 520/2003. The High Court directed the accused to appear before the Sessions Judge who would himself scrutinize whether the accused committed any offence or not. The matter is still pending.

The petitioner alleged that she cannot visit Lucknow as she apprehends danger to her life and the lives of her husband and small child. She has further alleged that her brothers have assaulted, humiliated and irreparably harmed the entire family members of her husband Bramha Nand Gupta and their properties, and even the remote relatives were not spared and were threatened to be killed. Their properties including the house and agricultural lands and shops were forcibly taken over by the brothers of the petitioner and the lives of the petitioner and her husband are in constant danger as her brothers have been threatening them.",Criminal Case

"J U D G M E N T R.C. LAHOTI, CJI Ashok Kumar Sharma, the respondent no.2 herein filed a First Information Report with police station, Division No. 3, Ludhiana, whereupon an offence under Section 304A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (for short ""the IPC"") was registered. The gist of the information is that on 15.2.1995, the informant's father, late Jiwan Lal Sharma was admitted as a patient in a private ward of CMC Hospital, Ludhiana. On 22.2.1995 at about 11 p.m., Jiwan Lal felt difficulty in breathing. The complainant's elder brother, Vijay Sharma who was present in the room contacted the duty nurse, who in her turn called some doctor to attend to the patient. No doctor turned up for about 20 to 25 minutes. Then, Dr. Jacob Mathew, the appellant before us and Dr.Allen Joseph came to the room of the patient. An oxygen cylinder was brought and connected to the mouth of the patient but the breathing problem increased further. The patient tried to get up but the medical staff asked him to remain in the bed. The oxygen cylinder was found to be empty. There was no other gas cylinder available in the room. Vijay Sharma went to the adjoining room and brought a gas cylinder therefrom. However, there was no arrangement to make the gas cylinder functional and in-between, 5 to 7 minutes were wasted. By this time, another doctor came who declared that the patient was dead. The latter part of the FIR states (as per the translation in English as filed by the complainant): ""the death of my father was occurred due to the carelessness of doctors and nurses and non availability of oxygen cylinder and the empty cylinder was fixed on the mouth of my father and his breathing was totally stopped hence my father died. I sent the dead body of my father to my village for last cremation and for information I have come to you. Suitable action be done Sd/- ---- As per statement of intimator the death of Jiwan Lal Sharma has occurred due to carelessness of doctors and nurses concerned and to fit empty gas cylinder.""

The Judicial Magistrate First Class, Ludhiana framed charges under Section 304A, IPC against the two accused persons, both doctors. Both of them filed a revision in the Court of Sessions Judge submitting that there was no ground for framing charges against them. The revision was dismissed. The appellant filed a petition in the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure praying for quashing of the FIR and all the subsequent proceedings.

It was submitted before the High Court that there was no specific allegation of any act of omission or commission against the accused persons in the entire plethora of documents comprising the challan papers filed by the police against them. The learned single Judge who heard the petition formed an opinion that the plea raised by the appellant was available to be urged in defence at the trial and, therefore, a case for quashing the charge was not made out. Vide order dated 18.12.2002, the High Court dismissed the petition. An application for recalling the abovesaid order was moved which too was dismissed on 24.1.2003. Feeling aggrieved by these two orders, the appellant has filed these appeals by special leave.

According to the appellant, the deceased Jiwan Lal was suffering from cancer in an advanced stage and as per the information available, he was, in fact, not being admitted by any hospital in the country because his being a case of cancer at terminal stage. He was only required to be kept at home and given proper nursing, food, care and solace coupled with prayers. But as is apparent from the records, his sons are very influential persons occupying important positions in Government. They requested the hospital authorities that come what may, even on compassionate grounds their father may be admitted in the hospital for regulated medical treatment and proper management of diet. It was abundantly made clear to the informant and his other relations who had accompanied the deceased that the disease was of such a nature and had attained such gravity, that peace and solace could only be got at home. But the complainant could prevail over the doctors and hospital management and got the deceased admitted as an in-patient. Nevertheless, the patient was treated with utmost care and caution and given all the required medical assistance by the doctors and para-medical staff. Every conceivable effort was made by all the attending staff comprising of doctors and nurses and other para-medicals to give appropriate medical treatment and the whole staff danced attendance on the patient but what was ordained to happen, did happen. The complainant and his relations, who were misguided or were under mistaken belief as to the facts, lodged police report against the accused persons  wholly unwarranted and uncalled for.",Civil Case
"JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(3) SCR 39 The following Order of the Court was delivered :

In these two petitions filed by the police inspectors serving the Gujarat State, it has been contended that prosecuting agency has no right to ask for remand of petitioners (accused) for the purpose of collecting evidence and the application moved for remand of the petitioner (accused) was unjustified because anticipatory bail was granted to them.
It is the prosecution version, as per the FIR lodged on 7.2.2002 by the Assistant Commissioner of Police 'D"" Division, Surat that petitioners and other police personnel are involved in offences punishable under Sections 429, 420, 465, 468, 477-A and 114 IPC. It is alleged that when they were working at various police stations, they have committed offences during the period from 20.2.1992 to 23.11.2001 by replacement of mudammal articles including golden ornaments by other spurious articles, misappropriation of the amount which was kept at the police station, unauthorised auction of the property which was seized and kept in the police custody pending trial and tampering with the records of police station. The High Court by its judgment and order dated 20.6.2002 rejected the application against the order passed by the trial court granting remand of the petitioner. Hence, these special leave petitions.
At the time of the hearing of these matters, learned counsel for the parties submitted that various articles are kept at the police station for a long period by not adhering to the procedure prescribed under Cr.P.C., which creates difficulties for keeping them in safe custody. Finally, the sufferers are-either the State exchequer or the citizens whose articles are kept in such custody. It is submitted that speedier procedure is required to be evolved either by the Court or under the rules for disposal of muddamal articles which are kept at various police stations as most of the police stations are flooded with seized articles. It is, therefore, submitted that directions be given so that burden of the Courts as well as at the police station can, to some extent, be reduced and that there may not be any scope for misappropriation or of replacement of valuable articles by spurious articles.
Learned counsel further referred to the relevant Sections 451 and 457 of Code of Criminal Procedure, which read thus-
""451. Order for custody and disposal of property pending trial in certain cases.-When any property is produced before any Criminal Court during any inquiry or trial, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the proper custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry or trial, and. if the property is subject to speedy and natural decay, or if it is otherwise expedient so to do, the Court may, after recording such evidence as it thinks necessary, order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of.
Explanation-For the purposes of this section, ""property"" includes (a) property of any kind or document which is produced before the Court or which is in its custody.
(b) any property regarding which an offence appears to have been committed or which appears to have been used for the commission of any offence.",Criminal Case

A senior general candidate at Level 1 has later reached Level 3 and by that date the reserved candidate is still at Level",Constitutional Case

In sum and substance, allegation levelled by the wife against the appellant is that demand of Rupees eight lacs, a maruti car, an air-conditioner, television set etc. was made by her mother-in-law and father-in-law and when this fact was brought to the appellant’s notice, he supported his mother and threatened to marry another woman. It has been alleged that she was driven out of the matrimonial home due to non- fulfilment of the demand of dowry.

1952. May 2, 5. The Court delivered judgment as follows :--

PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.--These appeals and petitions which fall into three groups raise the issue of the constitutional validity of three State enactments called The Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 (Bihar Act XXX of 1950), The Chief Jus- tice, in his judgment, dealt with the above Cases and Peti- tion and also Petitions Nos. 166, 228, 237, 245, 246, 257, 268, 280, to 285, 287 to 289, 317, 318 and 487 of 1951 (relating to the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950) and Cases Nos. 283 to 295 of 1951 (relating to the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950).
The Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 (No. I of 1951), and The Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 (U. P. Act No. 1 of 1951) (hereinafter referred to as the Bihar Act, the Madhya Pradesh Act and the Uttar Pradesh Act, respectively).
Certain other minor points were also raised in some of the cases but they are not worth mentioning as they proceed- ed either on a misapprehension or were palpably unsound. Thus all the objections raised to the constitutional validity of the Bihar Act, the Madhya Pradesh Act and the Uttar Pradesh Act or any part thereof fail and are over- ruled, MAHAJAN J.--This is an appeal under article 132 (3) of the Constitution of India from a judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Patna, dated the 12th March, 1951, whereby the High Court declared the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, ultra vires on the ground of its in- fringement of article 14 of the Constitution, but decided against the respondent on all other points. On the 30th December, 1949, a Bill intituled the Bihar Land Reforms Bill was introduced in the Legislative Assem- bly of Bihar and was passed by both the Houses of Legisla- ture, and after having been reserved for the consideration of the President of India, received his assent on the 11th September, 1950. The Act was published in The Bihar Govern- ment Gazette on the 25th September, 1950, and on the same day a notification under section 1 (3) of the Act was pub- lished declaring that the Act would come into force imme- diately. On the same day, a notification under section 3 of the Act was published stating that the estates and ten- ures belonging to the respondent and two others passed to and became vested in the State of Bihar under the provisions of the Act. The respondent filed a petition in the High Court of Judicature at Patna under article 226 of the Con- stitution, challenging the constitutionality of the said Bihar Land Reforms Act and praying for a writ in the nature of mandamus to be issued on the State of Bihar re- straining it from acting in any manner by virtue of, or under the provisions of, the said Act. This application was heard along with three title suits and other similar appli- cations filed by various zemindars of Bihar by a Special Bench of the High Court. By three separate but concurring judgments, the Court declared the Act to be unconstitutional and void on the ground of its infringement of fundamental right under article 14 of the Constitution. The validity of the Act was attacked before the High Court on the following grounds:

1. That the Bihar Legislature had no competence to pass it.
2. That it contravened clause (1) of article 81 of the Constitution.
3. That the vesting of the estates in the State of Bihar under the Act being in effect an acquisition of the estates, it was invalid as that acquisition was not for a public purpose and the provision for compensation was illusory.
4. That it contravened article 19 (1) (f) of the Consti- tution.
5. That some of its provisions were invalid on the ground of delegation of legislative powers.
6. That it was a fraud on the Constitution.
7. That it was unconstitutional as it contravened arti-",Constitutional Case

10.The notification impugned was accordingly held to be outside the scope of the Act and bad. (It was declared that the judgment shall not be applicable to foreign students and N.R.Is.). The Writ petition was allowed accordingly but Mohini fain was denied admission since ""she was not admitted to the college 3n merit and secondly the course commenced in March-April, 1991."" (The decision was rendered on 30.7.1992). It was directed that the said decision shall have only prospective operation and shall not affect the admissions already made in accordance with the said notification.

Before we deal with the above questions, it would be appropriate to notice the legal and relevant factual position obtaining in three others States, namely Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. All the matters before us arise from these four States only. Notice in these matters were however directed to all the States in the country. None has appeared excepting the above four States.

17.On 25.5.1992, the Government issued a notification inviting applications for permission to establish Medical, Dental and Engineering Colleges. The last date prescribed for receipt of applications was 8.6.1992. The applicants for Medical Colleges had to deposit within the said date a sum of rupees one crore in cash, furnish bank guarantee for another one crore and produce evidence of financial viability to the extent of four crores. A committee was appointed to inspect the land and other facilities offered by the applicants. The Committee formulated its guidelines on 28.6.1992 and submitted its report on 21.7.1992 recommending as many as 12 Medical Colleges and 8 Dental Colleges. The then Chief Minister approved the same on 27.7.1992 and a G.O. was issued on the same day granting permission. A number of Writ Petitions were immediately filed in the High Court challenging the said grant as well as Section 3-A.

18.There are a number of private engineering colleges in the State. Until the current academic year (1992-1993), all the seats in these colleges were filled in by the convenor of the common entrance examination. The management had no discretion or choice in the matter of admission of students. They were, however, permitted to charge a particular fees which was relatively higher than the fees charged in the Government Engineering Colleges. Nothing more. But when Section 3-A was introduced in the 1983 Act on 15.4.1992, these private engineering colleges took the stand that they are entitled to admit students to the extent of 50 per cent of the seats according to their choice, irrespective of merit, so long as they have qualified in the entrance test. It is obvious that such a stand meant collection of capitation fee as much as they could. There was an uproar among the student and teaching community against such admissions. Even the Government could not ignore the said protest and intimated the private engineering colleges on 26.7.1992 not to make any admissions till the Rules are made under Section 3-A. The engineering colleges, however, took the stand that they have already made the admissions according to their choice to the extent of 50 per cent. Indeed all this was facilitated by the fact that convenor allotted students to these engineering colleges only to the extent of 50 per cent of their respective capacity instead of 100% as usual thereby sending an explicit signal that the colleges were free to fill up the rest on their own. Be that as it may, these admissions led to the filing of a batch of Writ petitions in the Andhra Pradesh High Court. Following Mohini Jain and also on certain other grounds, a Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court allowed the Writ Petitions. It declared Section 3-A up-Constitutional. It also declared that the admissions made by the private Engineering Colleges to the extent of 50 per cent at their own choice was illegal. The Court further declared that the grant of permission to 12 Medical and 8 Dental Colleges was equally invalid. It is against the said decision that the State of Andhra Pradesh, certain educational institutions and the students admitted at the choice of the managements have come forward with a number of Special leave petitions.

23.Mahatma Gandhi Mission, Nanded, the appellant in C.A. No. 3573 of 1992 was permitted by the State Government to start an un-aided medical college at Aurangabad. It is stated that the appellant is a Public Charitable Trust registered under Societies Registration Act, 1860 as well as Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950. The medical college is affiliated to Marathwada University and is also recognised by the Maharashtra medical council. The total intake capacity is to seats each year. The permission to start medical college was accorded to the appellant on no-grant-in-aid basis. The appellant was allowed to fill 20% of the seats at their discretion from among those students who have obtained a minimum of 50% of the marks in the aggregate in specified subjects and have passed the qualifying examination in their first attempt. (There is no system of common entrance test in Maharashtra). Admissions were accordingly made for the current academic year. Soon after the decision of this court in Mohini Jain a large number of students filed a writ petition in the High Court of Bombay (Aurangabad Bench) claiming refund of the fee collected from them in excess of the fee prescribed by the Government for students admitted in government medical colleges for such course. A Division Bench made an interim order on 27th August, 1992 directing the appellant institution to furnish a bank guarantee to the extent of 50% of the excess amount collected by them from the students, i.e., in a sum of Rs. 42 lakhs pending disposal of the writ petition. It was further directed that pending disposal of the writ petition, the institution shall not collect any amount in excess of Rs. 3,000/ from any of the students. The said interlocutory order is challenged by the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 3572 of 1992.",Constitutional Case

"Considering the importance of the issue raised in the letter being concerned by frequent complaints regarding custodial violence and deaths in police lock up, the letter was treated as a writ petition and notice was issued on 9.2.1987 to the respondents.

In response to the notice, the State of West Bengal filed a counter. It was maintained that the police was no hushing up any matter of lock-up death and that whereever police personnel were found to be responsible for such death, action was being initiated against them. The respondents characterised the writ petition as misconceived, misleading and untenable in law.

While the writ petition was under consideration a letter addressed by Shri Ashok Kumar Johri on 29.7.87 to the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India drawing the attention of this Court to the death of one Mahesh Bihari of Pilkhana, Aligarh in police custody was received. That letter was also treated as a writ petition and was directed to be listed alongwith the writ petition filed by Shri D.K. Basu. On 14.8.1987 this Court made the following order :

""In almost every states there are allegations and these allegations are now increasing in frequency of deaths in custody described generally by newspapers as lock-up deaths. At present there does not appear to be any machinery to effectively deal with such allegations. Since this is an all India question concerning all States, it is desirable to issues notices to all the State Governments to find out whether they are desire to say anything in the matter. Let notices issue to all the State Governments. Let notice also issue to the Law Commission of India with a request that suitable suggestions may be returnable in two months from today.""
In response to the notice, affidavits have been filed on behalf of the States of West Bengal, Orissa, Assam Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Harayana, Tamil Nadu, Meghalaya , Maharashtra and Manipur.

"The cheque bearing No. 044483 was shown to have been a self drawn one for a sum of Rs. 1500/-.

3. Disputes and differences having arisen between the appellant and the said R.G. Bhat in connection with running of the said business, the power of attorney granted in his favour was cancelled by the appellant. Disputes and differences between the parties were referred to the Panchayat. In the meeting of the Panchayat held on 02.10.1996, complainant/respondent who is the brother-in-law of the said R.G. Bhat was admittedly present. He participated therein. The result of the said meeting of the Panchayat is not known but it is not in dispute that the appellant herein issued a public notice through his advocate in a local newspaper on 3.10.1996 to the following effect:

My client Sh. Krishna Janardhana Bhat, Proprietor of Vinaya Enterprises, Tarihal Hubli has given authority to give notice as follows.
My client appointed Shri Raghavendra Ganapati Bhat as his power of Attorney Holder on 21.8.1993 to run Vinay Enterprises as agent. He has started misusing the terms and conditions of the Power of Attorney. Hence my client cancelled the Power of Attorney on 21.8.96 by giving notice. If at all anybody deals with him on the Power of Attorney my client is not responsible in future.
5. On the premise that the respondent advanced a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- to the appellant on 14.6.1998 and the latter on his own went to his house on 20.7.1998 to return the loan by an account payee cheque which having been dishonoured when presented; a complaint petition was filed.
6. Prior thereto, a notice was sent on 27.8.1998 which was allegedly served on the appellant on 5.9.1998. He on that day itself sent a reply alleging in substance that the complainant had been colluding with R.G. Bhat in regard thereto, stating:
Your client D.G. Hegde Goddalamane is husband of sister of my power of attorney holder R.G. Bhat (Proprietor Prasad Enterprises Tarihal Industrial Estate) of Hubli. I do not have any dealing with him as alleged in your letter.
Knowing that the power of attorney holder R.G. Bhat has lost faith and having acted illegally and in anticipation of his committing further illegal acts I have legally cancelled my power of attorney and published the notice in a famous Kannada daily Samyukta Karnataka on 3.10.96. From that date I do not have any relation with him or any of his relatives including your client.
Please verify the handwriting and signature on the cheque and advice your client not to do such (illegalities) colluding with his brother-in-law.
7. The learned Trial Judge convicted the appellant and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for six months and further directed payment of compensation for a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/-. An appeal preferred thereagainst was dismissed by the Sessions Judge by a judgment and order dated 28.7.2004.
8. The High Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction, however, on a revision petition filed by the appellant, partly allowed the same by reducing the substantive sentence to one week.
9. The Special Leave Petition was filed by the appellant in person. As it was noticed by a Bench of this Court that some question of law arises for its consideration, Mr. S. Balakrishnan, learned senior counsel was requested to assist the Court.
10. Mr. Balakrishnan urged that the learned Trial Judge, the Sessions Court as also the High Court committed a serious illegality insofar as it misread and misapplied the provisions of Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (for short the Act).
(2) If so, whether the said cheque came to be dishonoured as funds insufficient after its presentation and despite of issuance of notice, the accused did not pay the due amount within stipulated time without any cause, thereby Negotiable Instruments Act? The learned Trial Judge noticed the contents of the claim petition as also the evidence of PW-1. It also noticed the suggestions given to the said PW-1 by the appellant herein. Upon taking into consideration the same as also the statement of the appellant under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it posed a question as to whether there was no debt payable by the accused to the complainant and if so, whether the complainant colluding with R.G. Bhat had created the cheque with an intention to cause loss to the appellant. It, however, without making any further discussion, answered the said question directly on the material brought on record referring to a decision of the Karnataka High Court in S.R. Muralidar v. Ashok G.Y. [ILR 2001 Karnataka 4127] in extenso and opining that his decision in the case is similar to that of the Karnataka High Court, stating:

Considering the proposition of law, in the present case also the accused admitted the signature on Ex.P.1. But, the contention is that his P.A. Holder mis-utilized his signed blank cheques through his relative complainant and the fact of the present case and fact of the decision mentioned by me are similar one and the observation made by the Honble High Court in the above decision and principle laid down therein are clearly applicable to the case in hand. Therefore, the defence taken by the accused herein without stepping into the witness-box, is not acceptable one and there is no cogent evidence produced by the accused to prove his special reasons for issuance of the cheque in question.
16. The appellate court took an identical stand. It proceeded on the premise that the statement of accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure regarding misuse of blank cheque by the complainant and filling up Rs. 1,50,000/- instead of Rs. 1500/- is contradictory to his own admission in the reply to the notice issued to him.

17. The High Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction although accepted the contention of the appellant that the presumption under Section 139 of the Act extends only to the extent that the holder of the cheque received the cheque for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability and the same only means that cheque was issued for consideration, but does not extend to the extent that the cheque was issued for the discharge of the debt or liability as pleaded by the accused, opined that the complainant had discharged that onus by adducing his own evidence. Observing that the appellant did not step into the witness box, it was opined that although the relationship between the appellant and Shri R.G. Bhat was strained, there was nothing to show that the relationship between the appellant and the complainant became strained despite the fact that a panchayat meeting was held in regard to the said dispute in 1996. The High Court, however, refused to go into the factual aspect of the matter stating that it was exercising a revisional jurisdiction, stating:

Since the burden of proving that the cheque had been misused is on the accused-petitioner, and there being a concurrent finding of the Trial Court and the Appellant Court with regard to that holding that the petitioner had failed to discharge that burden, I do not find any ground to interfere in the order of the Trial Court and that the Appellate Court, so far as they hold the petitioner guilty of an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
18. Before embarking upon the legal issues, we may analyse the deposition of PW-1  Complainant. He was a resident of village Goddalmane. Appellant is a resident of village Kekkar. As he was running an industry at Hubli, he sometimes resided in Hubli also. They were said to be friends. He asked him to give a loan of Rs. 1.5 lakhs in the first week of June, 1998 and the amount was handed over to him on 14th June, 1998. It was allegedly agreed that on the appellants failure to repay the said loan within one month, 15% interest would be charged. No document was executed; no pronote was executed; no receipt was obtained. Appellant is said to have come to his house suo moto on 20.07.1998 and handed over the cheque which was sent to Varada Grameen Bank for collection whereupon notice had been issued. Despite the fact that he was aware that a dispute had been raised in regard to the writings in the cheque, the same was not proved.",Criminal Case
"The Judgments of the Court were delivered by VERMA, J. A letter dated 14.9.1988 sent to this Court by Smt. Nilabati Behera alias Lalita Behera, was treated as a Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution for determining the claim of compensation made therein consequent upon, the death of petitioner's son Suman Behera, aged about 22 years, in police custody. The said Suman Behera was taken from his home in police custody at about 8 a.m. on 1.12.1987 by respondent No.6, Sarat Chandra Barik, Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police of Jaraikela Police Outpost under Police Station Bisra, Distt. Sundergarh in Orissa, in connection with the investigation of an offence of theft and detained at the Police Outpost. At about 2 p.m. the next day on 2.12.1987, the petitioner came to know that the dead body of her son Suman Behera was found on the railway track near a bridge at some distance from the Jaraikela railway station. There were multiple injuries on the body of Suman Behera when it was found and obviously his death was unnatural, caused by those injuries. The allegation made is that it is a case of custodial death since Suman Behera died as a result of the multiple injuries inflicted to him while he was in police custody; and thereafter his dead body was thrown on the railway track. The prayer made in the petition is for award of compensation to the petitioner, the mother of Suman Behera, for contravention of the fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.

The State of Orissa and its police officers, including Sarat Chandra Barik, Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police and Constable No.127, Chhabil Kujur of Police Outpost Jeraikela, Police Station Bisra, are impleaded as respondents in this petition. The defence of the respondents is that Suman Behera managed to escape from police custody at about 3 a.m. on the night between the 1st and 2nd December, 1987 from the Police Outpost Jeraikela, where he was detained and guarded by Police Constable Chhabil Kujur; he could not be apprehended thereafter in spite of a search; and the dead body of Suman Behera was found on the railway track the next day with multiple injuries which indicated that he was run over by a passing train after he had escaped from police custody. In short, on this basis the allegation of custodial death was denied and consequently the respondents' responsibility for the unnatural death of Suman Behera. In view of the controversy relating to the cause of death of Suman Behera, a direction was given by this Court on 4.3.1991 to the District Judge, Sundergarh in Orissa, to hold an inquiry into the matter and submit a report. The parties were directed to appear before the District Judge and lead the evidence on which they rely. Accordingly, evidence was led by the parties and the District Judge has submitted the Inquiry Report dated 4.9.1991 containing his finding based on that evidence that Suman Behera had died on account of multiple injuries inflicted to him while he was in police custody at the Police Outpost Jeraikela. The correctness of this finding and Report of the District Judge, being disputed by the respondents, the matter was examined afresh by us in the light of the objections raised to the Inquiry Report.",Constitutional Case

"Statement of complainant was recorded on 13.2.2002. By order dated 8.10.2002 the learned Judicial Magistrate held that sufficient material existed to proceed under Section 418 IPC against the appellants and, therefore, summons were issued for their appearance. An application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the 'Code') was filed before the High Court challenging legality of the order and summons. It was, inter alia, submitted that complaint was mis-conceived; the complainant had not come to Court with clean hands and had suppressed material facts. It was stated that the complainant had filed a Title Suit no.178/2002 before the learned Sub- Judge claiming his transfer order was mala fide. The prayer for interim protection was rejected.

There was no grievance made of any cheating neither in the civil suit nor in the matter pending before the Labour Court. The complaint was stale, and in any event, beyond the prescribed period of limitation as provided in Section 468 of the Code. It was pointed out that there was no proof of the complainant having resigned from his previous employment. There was no material to show commission of any offence even if complaint petition is considered in its entirety. No foundation for proceeding under Section 418 of the Code was made out. For the first time in 2002 the alleged breaches were agitated. Stand of the complainant on the other hand was that finally his claim was rejected on 15.12.2001 and subsequently his services were terminated on 29.4.2002. That being so, the plea of complainant having been filed beyond the period of limitation cannot be maintained. The petition was, as noted above, rejected by the High Court.",Criminal Case
"the order is challenged on the ground of mala fides or other similar grounds to which I have earlier referred. Before leaving this aspect of the case, it is necessary to refer to two other things. The first is a mistake appearing in the order of detention on which some argument was based by Dr. Lohia for quashing the order. It will be remembered that the order mentioned a certain Notification No. 180/CW. The Notification intended to be mentioned however was one No. 1 1 15/CW and the Notification No. 180/CW had been mentioned by mistake. It was under Notification No. II 15/CW that the power of the State Government to make an 'order of detention was delegated to the District Magistrate under the provisions of s. 40(2) of the Act to which I have earlier referred. The reference to the notification was to indicate the delegation of power. The Notification actually mentioned in the order did not, however, contain the necessary delegation. The result was that the order did not show on its face that the District Magistrate who had made it had the necessary authority to do so. This mistake however did not vitiate the order at all. Nothing in the rules requires that an order of detention should state that the authority making it has the power to do so. It may be that an order made by an authority to whom the Government's power has not been delegated, is a nullity and the order can be challenged on that ground. This may be one of the cases where an order good on its face may nonetheless be illegal. When the power of the person making the order is challenged, the only fact to be proved is that the power to make the order had been duly delegated to him. That can be proved by the necessary evidence, that is, by the production of the order of delegation. That would be a case somewhat like the Carltona case. In spite of the mistake in the order as to the Notification delegating the power, evidence can be given to show that the delegation had in fact been made. To admit such evidence would not be going behind the face of the order because what is necessary to appear on the face of the order is the satisfaction of the authority of the necessity for the detention for any of the reasons mentioned in r. 30 (1) (b) and not the authority of the maker of the order. The second thing to which I wish to refer is that it appeared from the affidavit sworn by the District Magistrate that prior to the making of the order, he had recorded a note which raja in these words : ""Perused the report of the Senior S. P. Patna for detention of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, M.P. under rule 30(1) (b) of the Defence of India Rules, on the ground that his being at .

Hidayatullah, J. Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, M.P., has filed this petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution asking for a writ of habeas corpus for release from detention ordered by the District Magistrate, Patna, under Rule 30(1)(b) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962. He was arrested at Patna on the night between 9th and 10th August, 1965. As it will be necessary to refer to the terms of the order served on him it is reproduced here ""ORDER No. 3912 C. Dated, Patna, the 9th August 1965 Whereas 1, J. N. Sahu, District Magistrate, Patna, am satisfied with respect to the person known as Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, Circuit House, Patna, that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety and the maintenance of law and order, it is necessary to make an order that he be detained.

In his affidavit Dr. Lohia stated that he was arrested at midnight on August 9, 1965 and was told that it was on charges of arson but later was served with the order of detention and that in this way his arrest for a substantive offence was turned into preventive detention. He further stated that the order of detention showed that he was to be detained in Bankipur Jail but the name of the Jail was scored out and ""Central Jail, Hazaribagh"" was substituted which led him to conclude that typed orders of detention were kept ready and that the District Magistrate did not exercise his mind in each individual case. He contended that his detention under Rule 30 (1) (b) was illegal because, according to him, that rule dealt with prejudicial activities in relation to the defence of India and civil defence and not with maintenance of law and order of a purely local character. He alleged that the arrest was mala fide and malicious; that it was made to prevent him from participating in the House of the People which was to go into Session from August 16 and particularly to keep him away from the debate on the Kutch issue. He further alleged that he had only addressed a very large gathering in Patna and had disclosed certain things about the Bihar Government which incensed that Government and caused them to retaliate in this manner and that detention was made to prevent further disclosures by him.",Civil Case
"The relevant facts, as per the evidence adduced and the First Information Report, are that on 26-02-1999, the deceased couple, namely, Vikas Nanda (D-1, age 26 years) and Kavita Nanda @ Priya Nanda (D-2, age 23 years), arrived in Goa from Mumbai for their honeymoon and stayed in Hotel Seema at Ribandar. On 27-02-1999, the deceased couple went for sight-seeing at Ozran, Vagator with P.W.13-Vincent, who was the car driver and had also taken them for the sight-seeing trip a day earlier as well. At about 2.30 p.m., D-1 told P.W.-13 that they had met some friends from Delhi and hence P.W.-13 returned from there. P.W.30-Suhasini Govekar, who operated a shack at Anjuna beach with her husband, mentioned that on 27-02-1999, the accused couple and their children came to her place in between 1.00-2.00 p.m. and then went to take bath. When they returned back, the deceased couple accompanied them. The accused couple was running a bar and the restaurant Iguana Miraj and hotel Lalita Beach Resort in Goa. P.W.11-Dinesh Adhikari, who was servant of the respondents, saw the deceased couple at respondents' hotel 2 or 3 days preceding the festival of Holi in the year 1999 at approximately 6.00-7.00 p.m. According to this prosecution witness, A-1-Sanjay Thakran, D-1-Vikas Nanda and P.W.14-Calvert were sitting outside the hotel and A-2-Anjali Thakran was sitting with D-2-Priya Nanda inside a room in the hotel. He saw A-1-Sanjay Thakran and D-1-Vikas Nanda walking towards the beach sometime after 9.00-9.30 p.m. and that was the last time when D-1 was seen alive. After sometime P.W.11 saw A-1-Sanjay Thakran, A-2-Anjali Thakran and D-2-Priya Nanda as they were walking away from Iguana Miraj. Another prosecution witness, P.W.14-Calvert Gonsalves also saw the deceased couple at the hotel of the accused couple. As per P.W.6-Amit Banerjee, who was working as a receptionist at Hotel Seema, D-2-Priya Nanda returned to Hotel Seema without D-1 and along with A-1-Sanjay Thakran at about 11.30 p.m. She asked for the key of their room from P.W. 6. A-1- Sanjay Thakran helped her to carry the luggage from the Hotel room as she checked out about 11.40 p.m. A-2 did not come to the hotel and remained seated in the white colour Maruti Car that had a Delhi registration number on it. D-2-Priya Nanda, A-1-Sanjay Thakran and A-2-Anjali Thakran went away in that car and thus, D-2 was also last seen alive in the company of the accused couple.

On 28-02-1999, P.W.2-Charles Mills lodged a report at Anjuna Police Station that a dead body of unknown female foreigner (later identified as D-2) was found at the Vagator Beach. According to this witness, who was staying near the beach, at around 7.30 a.m., he was told by someone that a female body was floating in the seawater. The deceased was wearing a blue skirt and a top. On the same day, P.W.17-Fausto Afonso lodged report with Colva Police Station that a dead body of unknown male foreigner (later identified as D-1) was found at about 00.30 hours at the Benaulim Beach. The distance between the Vagator Beach and Benaulim Beach is around 60 kilometers.

As the deceased couple neither returned to Delhi as expected by 01-03-1999 nor contacted P.W.33-Subhash Nanda i.e., father of D-1, he called up P.W.4-A.C. Duggal to inquire about them. Accordingly, P.W. 4-A.C. Duggal, who was uncle of D-1 and lived in Mumbai, called up N. Murari, who was posted in Goa and worked in the Union Bank of India with P.W.-4, to know about their whereabouts on 01-03-1999. N. Murari told P.W.-4 that they had already checked out of the Hotel Seema. Since the deceased couple did not reach Mumbai as stipulated by P.W.-4 on 02-03-1999, he again called up N. Murari. On 03-03-1999 at about 7.15 p.m., N. Murari informed P.W.-4 that a dead body of male person with similar description to that of Vikas had been found and asked him to come to Goa. P.W.-4 rushed to Goa and identified the dead body of D-1-Vikas Nanda on 04-03-1999. On the same day, N. Murari lodged a missing report [Exhibit No. 20] at Old Goa Police Station. After identifying the body of D-1-Vikas Nanda at morgue, P.W.-4 went to Seema Guest House and made inquiries about the couple. The dead body of D-2 was also identified on 05-03-1999. P.W.-4 lodged a complaint [Exhibit No.21] on 05-03-1999 at Anjuna Police Station with P.W. 38- Sub-Inspector Sandesh Chodankar. According to this complaint, on 04-03-1999, P.W.-4 was informed by Hotel Manager that D-2 checked out from hotel on 27-03-1999 at about 11.40 p.m. and another person having short built, bald from front and having fair complexion accompanied her. The complainant believed that since the dead bodies of the couple had been found at places nearly 60 kilometers away from each other, the newly married couple must have been lured by some disgruntled mischievous element, who had killed them for their ornaments, as all the gold ornaments of the deceased couple were found missing.

and it was opined that they were caused with blunt surface. The postmortem reports of both the deceased persons have concluded that death had occurred as a result of asphyxia due to drowning in shallow beach water.

From their initial investigation, the Goa police found out about the description of the accused couple and their children. The flat belonging to the accused persons was sealed under the orders of a Civil Court. P.W.-38, therefore, applied to the Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Margoa for issuance of search warrant. The Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Margoa directed that the bailiff of the Court would accompany P.W.-38 and in the presence of two respectable panchas from the locality, the seal of the court would be opened and inventory of the movable articles and fixtures found in the flat should be made. After the search, the flat should be resealed/locked and the bailiff would file a report to the Court. Accordingly on 17-12-1999, the police conducted search of the flat of accused, which was located at Sapna Residency, Colva. During this search, P.W.-38 attached the passports of the accused-respondents and their two children, two visiting cards of P.W. 19-Subrato Padhi, a visiting card of Iguana Restaurant and one laminated photograph. [House Search Panchnama as Exhibit No. 13 and Report regarding Search Warrant which was submitted to Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Margoa as Exhibit No. 108]. The Court bailiff, who accompanied with P.W.-38 and other panch witnesses, prepared a list of movable articles of the flat [Exhibit No. 112]. The flat was resealed after the search was over.

On 30-01-2000, the accused persons were arrested in Agra by P.W. 15- Police Inspector Navrang Singh, who was posted at police station of Sadar Bazar, Agra. P.W.-38 accompanied with Dy. Superintendent of Police P.W.29-Arvind Gawas, arrived at Agra on the same day. P.W.-15 informed them that A-1-Sanjay Thakran handed over a double barrel gun and A-2-Anjali Thakran took out and handed over a single barrel 12-bore gun from the cupboard. During the house search of the accused persons, police recovered a churidhar set, a ladies purse and some newspapers containing reports that were connected with investigation of the present case. According to the prosecution story, the recovered materials were identified by P.W.33-Subhash Nanda, father of Vikas and P.W.5- Kishen Valecha, brother of Priya as belonging to the deceased couple. P.W.38-Sandesh Chodankar, Sub-Inspector interrogated the accused persons and satisfied himself of their complicity in the crime. On 31-01-2000, he further obtained transit remand and custody of the accused couple. The accused were brought back to Goa on 01-02- 2000 and formally arrested in connection with the present case. On 08-02-2000, as alleged by prosecution, during the interrogation A-1-Sanjay Thakran disclosed to P.W. 38Sandesh Chodankar about the fact that murder of the deceased couple was committed by his wife and him and that the belongings of the deceased couple were present in his flat. On 11-02-2000, in presence of Court bailiff-Peter Fernandes and other panch witnesses, A-1 handed over jewellery from his flat B-2 F-3 at Sapna Residency, Colva. The jewellery, which was handed over to police, consisted of eight yellow metal bangles, one pair of ear-rings and one finger ring. As has been alleged by the prosecution side, he also produced clothes such as a white full-sleeves shirt, a saffron-coloured women's kameez with a cream-coloured salwar, a green-coloured saree with blouse, a light cream-coloured silken kurta pyjama and a designer black full-sleeves shirt, which belonged to the deceased couple. During interrogation, on 13-02-2000, A-2-Anjali Thakran allegedly disclosed [Exhibit No. 77] that she would point out the goldsmith to whom she had sold the gold ornaments. As per the directions of A-2-Anjali Thakran, a police party and panch witnesses reached the jewellery shop of P.W. 12-Ulhas Lotlikar at Khareband Margao. P.W.12-Ulhas Lotlikar produced two bangles bearing the identification mark 'RK 22 KL', weighing 23.5 grams. According to the prosecution case, the said bangles bearing the identification mark 'RK 22 KL' were gifted to the newly wed couple on their marriage by P.W.-33. The prosecution has alleged that A-2-Anjali Thakran sold these bangles along with a necklace and a ring to the jewellery shop run by P.W.-12. It has also been alleged by the prosecution that A-2- Anjali Thakran sold these jewellery on the pretext that as their restaurant was not running well, they were in urgent need of money. The learned Sessions Judge, Panaji, as well as the High Court on evaluation of the circumstantial evidence, came to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to prove involvement of accused respondents in commission of the crime and acquitted them of all charges.

P.W.6-Amit Banerjee, who was working as the Receptionist of Hotel Seema where the deceased couple stayed when they came to Goa, deposed that on 26.02.1999, D-1 and his wife D-2 had come to the hotel. They were provided a room which was reserved for the Union Bank of India as its holiday home. Mr. A.C. Duggal, General Manager of the Union Bank of India had informed him on phone that these guests were coming to the hotel and he should take care of them. On 27.02.1999 at about 2330 hours, D-2 came alone and asked for the room key and told him that she was checking out of the hotel. D-1-Vikas Nanda, the husband of D-2-Priya Nanda, was not along with her. He asked her why she was checking out at that odd time. At that, she informed that she had met some friends from Delhi and that she was going to join them. D-2 went to her room and he went to the reception area where the security guard was on duty. He asked the security guard as to how she had come to the hotel. The guard informed him that the guest had come in a car along with a man who had followed her to the room. He had noticed a white colour 800CC Maruti car parked outside the gate of the hotel and one lady with short hair was sitting on the rear seat. He noticed her for a minute or two. D-2 returned to the reception from her room within 15 minutes and A-1 was carrying the luggage. She settled the bill and thereafter left the hotel. In his cross-examination, this witness mentioned that when at reception counter D-2 was making the payment, he saw A-1 who passed along with the luggage putting his head down. In the Test Identification Parade on 07.02.2000, this witness identified A-1 as the person who came along with D-2 on 27.02.1999 when she checked out of the hotel and identified A-2 as the same lady who was sitting in the Maruti car on 27.02.1999. He stated that he did not find anything abnormal about the departure of D-2 and behaviour of D-2 at that time was normal. From the statement of this witness, it appears that he had merely a fleeting glance of A-2 sitting in the parked car and thus he had described her as the lady with a short hair. Although in the test identification parade conducted after more than 11 months he identified both the accused, but when the police recorded his statement on 07.03.1999 in Hotel Seema he had not given the description of the accused persons to the police to be the persons who came to his hotel along with D-2. The witness admitted that in the hotel register the check-out timing column was blank. Therefore, the record produced does not indicate the timing of departure of D-2 from Hotel Seema. The prosecution has also not examined the guard of the hotel to identify A-2 to be the person who was sitting in the car.",Criminal Case

"The HUDA maintains accounts as per ""Old Accounting Standards-7"" which prescribes that profit or loss of an organization is to be worked out after the completion of the project. For this HUDA has fixed for it a period of 20 years.

3.2 Brief facts and the basis taken by the Assessing Officer and by the Ld. CIT(A) are as under:

The AO while pointing out the various defects in the books of account has observed as under:-
""i) The assessee claims that it follows the cash system of accounting and yet, it is seen from the account of the assessee that the assessee is not showing the recoveries from the plots sold in the income and expenditure account for a period of 20 years. A sector is developed by way of acquisition of land, creation of basic infrastructure and development works and then the sector is plotted for the purpose of sale. Entire plots are sold off in the first 5 to 6 years of the scheme of the sector developed. The commercial and institutional areas in the sector are separately auctioned. In this entire activity which takes place in a span of nearly 10 years, when plots are sold, no profit from such sale of plots made by the assessee is taken to the profit and loss account. In other words, no income is shown by the assessee even after the plots are sold and full amount of installments has been received by it. The entire recoveries from the allotees of sold plots and auctioned areas continue to be shown as Advance from Customers'. Over the years, the assessee has not declared income in its returns filed from several such projects (each sector is taken as a project), but generated huge surplus which is shown from the surplus of cash and bank balance of as on 31.03:2006 among other current assets.
iii) The method of arbitrarily taking the period at 20 years before the sale consideration received from customers is recognized as a revenue receipt has no basis at all. This is more so as the assessee begins to debit expenses after a period of 10 years in relation to such ""incomplete"" sectors to the Income and Expenditure a/c as annual maintenance and development charges. This further establishes the inconsistency in the accounts whereby receipts or recoveries from sectors older than 10 years have been capitalized and kept as liability but the expenses of annual maintenance etc. on the same sectors are charged to the income and expenditure account.

iv) The period of 20 years has been taken arbitrarily & hypothetically without any basis. The assessee receives total payments from the allottees of plots within a period of six years. The project is also completed almost in that period. After receipt of the payment, the assessee deposit this amount in the bank which results in huge accumulation. This postponement of profit without any reason is in contravention to Section 3& 4 of the Income tax Act.

All the basic three contentions of the assessee are held to be incorrect on facts:

i)      Assessee is not a construction contractor.

iij     Assessee does not work on no-profit-no-loss basis. Registration

u/s : 12A has been disallowed to it.

iiii)    Assessee does not follow cash system of accounting. It does

The AO after pointing out the defects as mentioned above rejected the appellant's books of account u/s 145(3) of the Act.

Assessee is following a period of twenty years for treating a sector as a completed sector which is not in consonance with the accepted income tax law and practice.

Further more in respect of assessment year 2003-2004 to 2006-07, the Income tax department has accepted the applicability of AS 7 to the assessee, but have denied the benefit of the same to the assessee on the ground that the assessee is not a contractor AND/ OR is not following the revised AS 7. In fairness of situation or circumstances, it will be just and appropriate to reject the stance of the Income tax department that the AS 7 is not applicable to the assessee.

By virtue of its objectives, the assessee is engaged in activities of creating assets / combination of assets which are offered to public for sale on allotment basis. The activities are in the same nature as that of a builder, developer and promoter who creates building/ flats, plots and other structures and offer these to public for sale. In case of contractors offering built up flats for sale to potential buyers, there is no contract involved between the contractor and the potential buyers. The following works relating to civil construction outlined hereunder are also carried out by the assessee as well;

7. The Ld. AR argued that the assessee since inception is engaged in the activities of acquisition of land, development, and .after selling the plots. The books of accounts of the assessee are maintained on cash system of accounting on double entry system following ""Completed Contract Method"" as per Accounting Standard 7, prescribed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The method of accounting has been consistently followed by the assessee for the past more than 30 years. The same has been accepted by the department in the past years.

viii. In view of the detailed facts mentioned above, books of accounts of the assessee were rejected u/s 145(3) of the IT. Act, 1961.

18. The addition on account of indirect charges claimed by the assessee in Income & Expenditure Account of the Commercial Sectors was made by the AO for the first time in AY 2007-08 by estimating the 60% of the total recoveries as income. After rejecting the books of account and method of accounting followed by the appellant, the AO proceeded to compute appellant's income keeping in view the past history of the case as well as by adjudicating the new issues which arose during the year. The AO observed that a portion of recoveries made by the assessee during the year is relatable to indirect charges received by the assessee. The AO observed that the assessee is debiting all the indirect charges i.e. charges in the nature of administrative charges, interest charges to the income & expenditure account. As per the AO the amount received by way of indirect charges should be included in the income of the appellant. The AO after going through the details/costs sheet of Jagadhri Urban Estate noted that 29.79% of the total receipts to be attributable to indirect charges and proposed to tax the same on receipts basis. The AO asked the assessee to furnish the costs sheets of other Urban Estates. The assessee however informed that the cost ratios are the same for all the costs sheets for various Estates as worked out in the earlier year i.e. 2005-06 & 2006-07. The AO noted that addition on these lines has been made by the AO in the earlier years also by taking the ratio of indirect charges received @ 30% of total recoveries. The appellant however contested the proposed addition and submitted as under :-

"" The AO has bifurcated the sums received by HUDA from plots as under:-
             a) Land Cost-            14.02%
             b) Development Cost-      44.61%
             c) Indirect charges-    29.79%
             d) Others-               11.30%

Out of indirect charge at 29.79%, commercial interest escalation charges, license fees, conversion charges, security fees and services charges totaling to 22.2% are not retained by the assessee at all and are parted by it either with the government or with the plot owner under directions of the court.
18.1 The AO however rejected the appellant's contention observing that the same cannot be accepted because the indirect charges comprises of commercial interest, which is nothing but notional commercial interest calculated on development cost, which comprises of nearly l/3rd of the total development cost. Further, price escalation and unforeseen charges which comprises of nearly l/4th of the total indirect charges are also purely on estimate basis. Thus the contention of the assessee that 22.2% of the total indirect charges of 29.79 % are not retained by it is factually incorrect. Further, as per the AO other charges at 11.36% are also adhoc and have nothing to do with actual expenses incurred.
18.2 The AO further observed that the total land developed and sold by the appellant consist of both residential and commercial area. The indirect charges received on account of the same vary on residential and commercial properties. The AO noted that the cost sheet of the assessee just takes the saleable area under residential sectors into consideration and the cost of plot is worked out on the same. When confronted during the assessment proceedings, the AR of the assessee accepted that cost of commercial sites are not included while preparing » cost sheet in respect of residential sectors. The AO computed the following calculations with regard to allocation of land to commercial and residential area and its costing by referring to cost sheet in respect of residential area in sector-33 Part Karnal.
Planned Area                             240.00 Acres
Less:
Released Land                            30.54 Acres
Balance Area                             209.46 Acres
Area under shopping Centre               46.75 Acres
HUDA land Area                           1.10 Acres
institution                              2.86 Acres
                                         50.71 Acres
Balance Area Saleable plot area          158.75 Acres
Under Plots                              51.88 Acres
Nursing Home/Clinic                      1.70 Acres
                                         53.59 Acres

Saleable Area = 53.58/158.75 = 33.75% or 1634 Sq. yds

Rate per Sq Yd = 7585660/1634 = 4642 per Sq. yd.

Add Loss of EWS Plots            = 590
Add infrastructural cost         = 50

5282 per Sq. yd. (Rs. 6317 per Sq. mtr.)

Approved Rate                    = 6317 per Sq. mtr

18.3 As per the AO the assessee in its computation sheet has excluded the commercial Area from saleable Area and then computing the rate of saleable area for residential plots. It has even absorbed loss of EWS plots genuineness of which are to be ascertained. The AO also noted that the land carved out for commercial purpose like shopping centre and institutions is not even taken in to consideration by the assessee who claims to be running its business on 'No profit No Loss' basis. In the above computation, the AO noted land for commercial purposes is equivalent to residential land which may vary in other cases. The land cost of the commercial part of the sector comes to Rs.5500/- per sq. mtr (approx) as loss of EWS plots is already absorbed in residential plots. However, the commercial plots are not sold at the cost price, but instead auctioned. The selling price of the commercial plots is higher than the residential plots by in the range of 5 to 40 times. The appellant was asked to submit the details with regard to detail of auction of commercial property during the year. Though, complete details were not filed by the appellant. The AO observed that the auction price of commercial property invariably is double the reserve price in most of the cases. The AO noted that in Gurgaon the reserve price as high as Rs.1.25 lacs per sq. mt. and the actual auction price in case of single story booth without basement for Sector- 21 worked out to be more then Rs.2 lacs per sq. mt. as detailed below :-
Sector Particular Site No. Area Reserve Price Auction Sale price / Price meter A 21 Single Storey 32 22.68 mts 14.95 Lakh 46 Lakh Rs. 2,02,82222 Booth B 21 -do- 33 22.68 mts 14.95 Lakh 47 Lakh Rs. 2,07,231 C 21 -do- 34 22.6 mts 14.95 Lakh 45.50 Lakh Rs. 2,00,617 18.4 As per the AO the margins in commercial property are very high keeping in view the rates of residential area which was in the range of Rs.6,000/- to Rs.8,000/- per sq.mt. The AO also referred to an auction in F.Y 2008-029 in which a commercial site fetched Rs.5 lacs per sq.mt.
18.5 The AO also observed that that in Gurgoan, a few sectors have been carved out for commercial purposes only which are not reflected in the accounts of the assessee. Further, the completed sector accounting for the FY 2006-07 drawn out for different sectors by the assessee from which excess of Recovery over development is drawn out and shown in income and Expenditure account, does not take into consideration the sale of commercial site as well as the closing stock of commercial sites, to grossly understate its income.
19. During the assessment proceedings, the assessee was asked to give details of 'Total Recoveries from allottees with break up regarding new sale proceeds from commercial and residential sectors and old recovery. The appellant file details giving the break up as desired. However, details with regard to recovery from allottees with regard to installment of plots amounting Rs.889.70 crores has not been given. As per the details filed new sales from residential plots has been was shown at Rs.273.33 crores and new sales from commercial plots were shown at Rs.289.53 crores. However, no break up of recovery from allottees with regard to old sales was furnished. In absence of details regarding recovery from allottees, with regard to old sales by the assessee, the AO made an estimate of component of sale of the commercial sites at 50%, as the buyers are allowed to pay the balance amount in commercial sites over nearly the same time frame as done in the residential sector.
20. In view of the facts as mentioned above the AO referring to the earlier assessment year held that 30% of the recoveries from sale of projects which correspond to the heads of expenditure which are booked by the assessee directly to his income and expenditure is to be taken as income from residential sectors. However, with regard to the recoveries from sale of commercial plots, 60% of these receipts were proposed to be taken as income of the assessee during the year. The higher rate was estimated far commercial properties keeping in view the fact that the income from sale of commercial plots for exceeds the income from sale of residential plots.
20.1. The AO worked out the income from receipts as under:
Recoveries from commercial sites From New Sales Rs. 289.53 Cr.
From Old Sales (50% of Rs. 805.96)             Rs. 402.98 Cr
                  Total                        Rs. 692.51

Recoveries from residential sites     Rs. 676.30 Cr.
Income of the assessee during the year
Residential Sites -      30% of Rs. 676.30 Cr      = Rs. 202.89 Cr
Commercial Sites -       60% of Rs. 692.51 Cr      = Rs. 415.50 Cr

                 Total Income                                  = Rs. 618.39 Cr



20.2 The AO thus worked out a total addition of Rs.618,39,00,0008/- on account of revenue generated from residential site and commercial site applying a rate of 30% & 60% respectively.
21. The assessee has challenged the addition before he Ld.CIT(A) and has submitted that the addition is totally uncalled for.
""""The addition was made taking off the addition on same premise made in respect of assessment year 2004-05, where it was held as under while making the addition As the assessee has claimed Indirect Charges including administrative expenditure, which works out to Rs.29.90%, of the total cost of the project as revenue expenditure the corresponding proportion of the receipt of recovery from allottee also needs to be taken. The same is calculated hereunder:""
The amount has paid to the State Government on account of License Fee, Conversion Charges, Infrastructure Development Charges and Scrutiny Fee as per the circular of the State Government applicable at that time. The amount of Rs.5000.00 lacs was paid on this account during the financial year 2006-07, the details of which is given as under:-

License Fee                                Rs. 968.16
Con version Charges                        Rs. 1231.84
Infrastructure Dev.Charges                 Rs.2699.52
Scrutiny Fee                               Rs. 100.48


Total                                       Rs.5000.00


It is argued that the said assumptive NP rate of 29.93 pc was applied on the total amount received from the allottees during the year under question and was treated to be income of the assessee from sale of plots. It is further brought out that while arriving at an assumed income element of Rs.42.88 crores comprised in the sums received from the allottees, the Assessing officer failed to consider a very pertinent fact into consideration that the sums received from the assessee also included an amount of Rs.42.88 received from the allottees towards enhanced compensation which were in the nature of cross / transfer entry and did not partake or contain any element of ownership or retention by HUDA. As a result of adopting this postulate / posture, the Assessing Officer has arrived at an excessive income of Rs.12.864 crores.""

21.2 The appellant further referred to the assessment order for the year 2008-09 wherein the AO himself has computed the income from sale of commercial plots by applying a rate of 50% as compare to 60% taken during the year under appeal.

5. ADDITION ON ACCOUNT OF INDIRECT CHARGES OF COMMERCIAL SECTORS: The addition on account of indirect charges claimed by the assessee in Income & Expenditure Account of Commercial Sectors was made by the AO for the first time in AY 2007-08 by estimating the 60% of the total recoveries as income. AO points out that the cost sheet of the assessee takes into the saleable area of residential plots in any sector into consideration and the cost of residential plot is worked out on the same. Assessee has submitted that the cost of commercial sites is not included while preparing in cost sheet in respect of residential sectors. Thus, what the assessee is doing smartly in its computation sheet is excluding the commercial Area from saleable Area and the computing the rate of saleable area for residential plots. Thereafter, land carved out for commercial purpose like shopping centre and Institutions is not even taken into consideration by the assessee in its' computation sheet for sector, though it claims to be running its' activities on ""No Profit No Loss"". The selling price of the commercial plots are higher than the residential plots within the range of 5 to 40 times the cost of residential plot in the sectors developed by HUDA. The profit generated and the income from sale of commercial plots far exceeds the income from sale of residential plots. However, with regard to the recoveries from sale of commercial plots, 60% of these receipts are taken as income of the assessee during the year. This figure is taken as higher than 30% taken for sale of residential plots.",Administrative Case
